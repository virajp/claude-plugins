# uv — conventions

uv is the only package manager, and it is more than a resolver: it owns the
lockfile, the `.venv`, and running what it installed. A repo that installs with
uv and runs with a hand-activated virtualenv has two environments and only one
of them is locked.

**The lockfile is committed and authoritative.** `uv sync` resolves from it;
nothing in the ordinary install path is allowed to move it.

**Nothing runs outside the environment.** Every Python entrypoint the task
library invokes goes through `uv run`, so the version that executes is the
version the lockfile pinned — including the gates, which is why the `ruff` pack
calls `uv run ruff` rather than a `ruff` on `PATH`.

**Install and upgrade are separate verbs, and Python is the only overlay that
splits them.** `setup:deps:install` is `uv sync --all-extras` and never moves a
pin; `setup:deps:upgrade` is `uv lock --upgrade` followed by the same sync, so
moving the lockfile forward is always something someone asked for. The node
overlay has no `upgrade` verb at all.

That asymmetry is not an omission to reconcile. **The optional `setup/deps/*`
verbs are probed by name**: a verb a pack does not ship means the manager has
no such verb, not that the choice is still pending. `setup:deps:all` calls what
it finds.

**This pack is authored but not yet reachable, and that is expected.** It
declares `kind: language-bundle`, but there is no `language/python` component
and no python bundle for it to compose into, so no materialization can land it
today. Authoring the python language bundle against the 12-topic bar, with
per-topic research, is its own wave — this is not a bug to fix in passing.

The gates that run against this environment are the `ruff` pack.
