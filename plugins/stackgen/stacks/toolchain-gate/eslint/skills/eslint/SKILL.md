# Lint & Format Gate

Two independent gates, split by concern — **both must pass before a commit**:

- **Lint** — `@askviraj/linter`, a self-contained ESLint CLI that bundles ESLint
  and every plugin (TS, JSON/JSONC, CSS, HTML, Markdown, YAML, TOML, Astro). It
  owns **correctness**.
- **Format** — `dprint` (config in `dprint.json`), plus `sort-package-json` for
  `package.json` key order. It owns **whitespace and layout**.

Keep them apart: dprint reformats, the linter finds real problems. There are no
formatting rules in the linter and no correctness rules in dprint — don't make
one do the other's job.

A repo that already has its own ESLint setup keeps it; do not migrate one
uninvited.

## Flat config only

`eslint.config.js` (or `.mjs`/`.ts`), never `.eslintrc*`. The legacy format is
end-of-life, its cascade resolution is invisible, and the two formats do not
compose — a repo carrying both is running whichever one that ESLint version
happens to prefer.

An `.eslintrc*` file found in a repo is a migration to raise, not a file to
edit.

## Running it

In a mise repo, run through the task library — the tasks add the wrappers and
target the whole tree:

```sh
mise run code:format          # dprint check (verify) + sort-package-json --check
mise run code:format --fix    # dprint fmt (apply) + sort-package-json
mise run code:lint            # pnpm dlx @askviraj/linter
mise run code:lint --fix      # apply the linter's auto-fixes
mise run code:all             # aggregate: format → lint → sec
```

Direct invocation (what those tasks wrap):

```sh
# Lint — defaults to the current directory
pnpm dlx @askviraj/linter
pnpm dlx @askviraj/linter --fix          # auto-fix what's mechanical
pnpm dlx @askviraj/linter src/ tests/    # limit to targets
pnpm dlx @askviraj/linter --cache        # only changed files

# Format
dprint check --config dprint.json        # verify (CI / pre-commit)
dprint fmt   --config dprint.json        # apply
```

The linter is **zero-config** — it ships an opinionated flat config, so no
`eslint.config.*` or plugin installs are needed in the repo.

## Customizing

Only reach for config when a default genuinely misfires — never to make a real
finding disappear.

- **Linter:** edit `.config/linter.yaml` — this pack ships it, empty of
  overrides, so the file to change already exists. Scope changes narrowly:
  extra `ignores`, per-preset `overrides`
  (preset names: `javascript`, `typescript`, `astro`, `json`, `jsonc`,
  `markdown`, `markdown-typescript`, `yaml`, `toml`, `html`, `css`), or a
  `configs` entry that targets specific `files`. Prefer a `files`-scoped
  override to a global one.
- **Plain ESLint** — a trailing config object with `files` narrowed to the
  affected glob. Flat config is last-wins, so ordering is the mechanism.
- **Formatter:** edit `dprint.json` (`includes`/`excludes`, per-language
  `lineWidth`, the `exec` block for external formatters like `taplo`).

A `files`-scoped override states *where* the rule is wrong; a global one states
that nobody wanted to look.

An inline `eslint-disable` is acceptable for a genuinely one-off case **with a
reason on the same line**. A bare `eslint-disable` at the top of a file is not:
it silently covers every rule for every future edit to that file.

## Failure remedies

- **Format check fails** → run `dprint fmt` (or `mise run code:format --fix`).
  It's mechanical; never hand-fix whitespace to satisfy it.
- **`package.json` order fails** → `mise run code:format --fix` runs
  `sort-package-json`.
- **Lint fails** → `--fix` clears the mechanical ones; the rest are real. Fix
  the code, don't loosen the rule. If a rule is genuinely wrong for a file,
  scope an override in `.config/linter.yaml` to that `files` glob — never
  disable it globally to get green.
- **The two disagree on a line** → they shouldn't; if a lint rule fights
  dprint's formatting, that's a rule to scope off in `.config/linter.yaml`,
  since dprint is the formatting authority.

## Where this stops

Which rules a language should enable, and the language's own idioms, belong to
the language's own skill (the `typescript` skill for TS/JS). This skill covers
the gate's shape, its config format, and how overrides are scoped.
