# grype — the vulnerability scanner

grype scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It runs inside `code:sec`
alongside `gitleaks`, so it gates every commit and runs again in CI.

The config lives at **`.config/grype.yaml`** and ships with the repo, carrying
the threshold and an empty ignore list. grype reads `.grype.yaml` or
`GRYPE_CONFIG` on its own and finds neither there, so `code:sec` passes
`--config`. Edit it to move the threshold or to record an ignore, never to
enable scanning.

Unlike the secret scanner, **grype ships no pre-commit hook**. It reaches the
commit gate only through `code:sec`; remove that task and nothing else runs it.

```sh
mise run code:sec               # grype + gitleaks, the commit gate
grype dir:. --config .config/grype.yaml --fail-on medium
grype <image>:<tag>             # the built image, before release
```

## Scan two things, at two moments

They find different problems and neither substitutes for the other:

- **The source tree**, on every commit. This catches what the lockfile
  introduced — a transitive dependency picked up by a routine update.
- **The built image**, before release. This catches the base image's OS
  packages, which no lockfile mentions and which are usually the larger share of
  a real image's findings.

A pipeline that scans only the source ships CVEs in the base layer and reports
green.

## Fail on a threshold, and pick it deliberately

```yaml
# .config/grype.yaml
fail-on-severity: medium
```

`medium` is what ships: anything medium or above fails, low and negligible are
reported. Set the threshold where the team will actually act. A threshold of
`low` on a typical dependency tree produces a wall of findings, and a gate
nobody can clear gets bypassed rather than fixed — which is strictly worse than
a higher threshold honestly enforced.

`code:sec` also spells `--fail-on medium` at the call site, so the threshold is
readable where the gate is invoked. The file is the home of the decision; move
both or neither.

**On an existing repo, establish a baseline rather than lowering the bar.** The
first `mise run code:sec` over a never-scanned tree usually fails; upgrade each
finding that has a fix, and copy the vulnerability id of each one that does not
under `ignore:` in `.config/grype.yaml` with a one-line `# reason` and re-check
date, then re-run until green. The threshold stays `medium`. The full procedure
is the pack's conventions, under "Establishing a baseline on an existing repo".

## Every ignore gets a reason and an expiry

```yaml
ignore:
  # CVE-0000-0000 — reachable only from a code path this product does not use.
  # Re-check 2026-12-01; upstream fix expected in 3.x.
  - vulnerability: CVE-0000-0000
```

An ignore with no note is indistinguishable from an oversight six months later,
and an ignore with no re-check date outlives the fix it was waiting for. Prefer
upgrading the dependency; ignore only when there is genuinely nothing to upgrade
to, and say so.

Never widen an ignore to a package or an ecosystem to clear one CVE — that
silences every future finding in it.

## Where this stops

Which dependencies a project takes on, and their supply-chain settings
(cooldowns, trust policy, build allowlists), belong to the language plugin's
package-manager doctrine. This skill covers scanning and its gate.
