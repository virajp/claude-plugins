# Workers Static Assets — identity shape

The least-privilege grant this service needs. The account-side model —
account-owned scoped tokens over the Global API Key, one identity per
workload, why the roles are broader than they look, and the privilege
review that catches what accumulates — is the `cloudflare` skill's
identity and IAM reference, which this cites and does not restate.

**There is only one identity in play here, and that is the whole shape.**
Nothing runs on a request, so there is no runtime identity, no workload
credential and nothing for the deployment to authenticate *to*. The only
credential that exists is the one the pipeline uses to publish.

## The deploy credential

**An account-owned API token, scoped to editing Workers scripts on the one
account.** Not a user-owned token, which dies with the user's membership
and turns an ordinary departure into a pipeline outage. Not the Global API
Key, which carries the whole account and cannot be narrowed.

Two permissions are usually involved and it is worth knowing which is
which, because a token that deploys but cannot route fails in a way that
looks like a DNS problem:

| Needed for | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Uploading and publishing the Worker and its assets | Account, Workers Scripts — edit |
| Binding it to a custom domain (`routes` with `custom_domain`) | The zone that hostname lives in |

The second is only needed where the route is managed by wrangler rather
than created once by hand. **Prefer creating the custom domain once,
manually, and leaving the pipeline's token without zone permissions** —
the route changes approximately never, and a token that can edit DNS for a
production zone is a much larger credential than one that can replace a
file set.

Confirm the exact current permission names against Context7 rather than
this file; Cloudflare renames them, and a token created from a stale name
fails with an authorization error that says nothing about which permission
was missing.

## The two environment variables

`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. The account id is not
a secret — it identifies, it does not authorize — but it is injected the
same way for the same reason every other environment value is: so the
deploy task reads its configuration from one place.

Both are **account-wide values shared across every repo that deploys to
the account**, so the secrets convention names them
`GLB_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `GLB_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, the prefix
stackgen's secrets contract reserves for an account-wide value, rather
than with a per-repo prefix. Catalogued by name and never by value in
`docs/blueprint/environment.md`.

**There is no keyless story available here, and claiming one would be
worse than naming the secret and handling it properly.** The token is a
secret held by the pipeline. Give it an expiry, and prefer re-issuing to
extending: a credential with no expiry is one whose owner nobody has had
to name since it was created.

## `wrangler login` is not the pipeline's path

It is an interactive OAuth grant stored on one laptop, and it is genuinely
convenient for a developer running a one-off deploy. CI has no browser and
no laptop; a pipeline depending on someone's grant is one that breaks when
they leave, and the failure arrives as an authorization error nobody
associates with a departure.

## What has no identity at all

- **The served site.** Every asset is public to anyone who requests it.
  There is no per-request identity, no authorization hook and no way to
  make one file readable and another not — that would require a script
  fronting the assets, which is a different stack.
- **A path nobody links to is not protected.** Everything in the uploaded
  directory is served, so "unlisted" is not a permission model. Anything
  that must not be public must not be in the build output — the same rule
  [artifact](artifact.md) states from the build's side.

Where a static site genuinely must be reachable only by named people, the
answer is the account's identity-aware proxy in front of it —
`cloud-service/zero-trust-access`, a second pin on the same axis — and
that component owns the policy, the groups and the service tokens.

## Separation between environments

A production deployment and a preview deployment are two Workers on one
account, so one token that can edit Workers scripts can publish to both.
Where that is not acceptable, the answer is **a separate account**, not a
cleverer token — account scope is the floor, which is the provider
doctrine's point and applies here unchanged.
