# The five mise config files

The annotated skeleton for each file in the `.config/` split. Read this before
writing or editing any of them. The rules that decide **which** file a tool,
setting or env value belongs in — and the Node gpg rule — stay in the skill
itself and are not repeated here.

Four of the five ship as this pack's `config/` payload, so a materialized repo
already has them; the fifth is never shipped and only ever written by hand. This
reference is what you author against when a repo needs something the payload did
not cover, or when you are editing one that landed.

## The five, and how one is selected

| File              | Loaded when            | Holds                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `mise.toml`       | always                 | shared settings, the runtime, `[tasks.init]`   |
| `mise.dev.toml`   | `MISE_ENV=dev`         | dev tooling, shell aliases, local env values   |
| `mise.ci.toml`    | `MISE_ENV=ci`          | the pipeline's and production's overrides      |
| `mise.test.toml`  | `MISE_ENV=dev,test`    | test deltas, layered on top of dev             |
| `mise.local.toml` | always, last           | **never committed** — this machine's overrides |
| `mise.<env>.lock` | not loaded — written   | the versions each config's fuzzy pins resolved to |

The sixth row is not a sixth file to author: `mise install` writes **one lock
per config file that declares tools**, named after that file's stem. With the
split as shipped — an empty base `[tools]`, nine tools in `mise.dev.toml` — the
only file produced is `mise.dev.lock`, and a runtime pinned in `mise.toml` would
add `mise.lock` beside it. **They are tracked**, which is the whole point:
`locked = true` in `mise.ci.toml` makes the pipeline a reader of what a laptop
resolved. Only `mise.local.lock` is ignored, matching its config.

mise loads `mise.toml` first, then deep-merges the active `MISE_ENV` variants on
top, then `mise.local.toml` and `mise.<env>.local.toml` last of all. So a
variant holds **deltas** and never a copy of the base.

- **`MISE_ENV` is a comma list and the last entry wins.** `MISE_ENV=dev,test` is
  what makes `mise.test.toml` a delta on dev rather than a fourth full config —
  it is never selected alone.
- **Developers** export `MISE_ENV=dev` in their shell. **Pipelines** set
  `MISE_ENV=ci` in the workflow env. With `MISE_ENV` **unset**, only
  `mise.toml` loads — the minimal, portable base.
- A repo with **no CI/CD, no deploy target and no separate test environment**
  needs only `mise.toml`. The others cost nothing empty and are shipped so the
  answer to "where does this go" never requires creating a file first.

## `mise.toml` — the common base

```toml
[settings]
activate_aggressive  = true     # let mise shims win on PATH
all_compile          = false    # never build a tool from source
env_shell_expand     = true     # expand $VARS in [env]
gpg_verify           = true     # verify tool signatures (see the CI exception)
raw                  = true     # streams output
status.missing_tools = "always"

# Latest, with a quarantine: a fuzzy pin resolves to the newest release at least
# this old, so a version yanked hours after publication is never what a fresh
# clone installs. mise's own default is 24h.
minimum_release_age = "10h"

# Record every resolved version in a lockfile, which IS committed. One lock per
# config file that declares tools, named after its stem. That is what makes
# "latest" reproducible.
lockfile = true

task.output = "interleave"
task.timings = true                        # elapsed time after each task
task.disable_spec_from_run_scripts = true  # flags come from #USAGE, not from a run

# Node settings — only when the project uses Node
node.compile        = false
npm.package_manager = "pnpm"

# Python settings — only when the project uses Python
pipx.uvx            = true
python.compile      = false
python.uv_venv_auto = "create|source"

[env]
# Only what is identical in every environment.
DISABLE_TELEMETRY = 1

# A marked position: the orchestrator fills it with this repo's project id (the
# slug `assets/ids.md` defines). A LITERAL — never derived from the config root,
# whose basename is the branch name inside a linked worktree.
REPO_NAME = "unfilled"

[tools]
# Language RUNTIME only — the minimum to run/build the project anywhere. It
# arrives with the language and package-manager components, not with this one.
node = { version = "latest" }
pnpm = { version = "latest" }

[tasks.init]
# Mandatory — chmod the file-based tasks under .config/mise/tasks/ executable.
# Lives in the BASE (not dev) so tasks are runnable in every env, CI included.
description = "Initialize mise tasks"
hide        = true
run         = "find .config/mise/tasks/ -name '*' -type f -not -path '*/*.env' -exec chmod 755 {} \\;"
```

**`minimum_release_age` and `lockfile` are one policy, not two.** The freshness
rule is *latest, but defer anything released in the last ten hours*, and the
pipeline installs from the lockfile rather than resolving at all. Together they
mean a developer moving a version forward is a deliberate act with a diff, and
CI never picks up a release nobody has run.

## `mise.dev.toml` — the developer laptop

```toml
[settings]
env_shell_expand     = true
status.missing_tools = "always"

[tools]
actionlint = { version = "latest" }
dprint     = { version = "latest" }
gitleaks   = { version = "latest" }
grype      = { version = "latest" }
jq         = { version = "latest" }
pre-commit = { version = "latest" }
shellcheck = { version = "latest" }
shfmt      = { version = "latest" }
taplo      = { version = "latest" }

[shell_alias]
setup     = "mise run setup:all"
precommit = "mise run code:precommit"
worktrees = "mise run code:worktrees"
# One per member project, when this repo has members:
# setup-backend  = "mise run setup:all --backend"
# setup-frontend = "mise run setup:all --frontend"

[env]
PRE_COMMIT_HOME = "$HOME/.cache/pre-commit"

# Node-only, when the runtime is Node:
# NODE_NO_WARNINGS = 1
# _.path           = { path = "node_modules/.bin", tools = true }

# The DEVELOPMENT values for anything the app reads at runtime. The NAMES must
# match what mise.ci.toml overrides.
# LOG_LEVEL   = "trace"
# RUNTIME_ENV = "development"
```

**`[shell_alias]` lives here and nowhere else.** Aliases need `mise activate`,
which is a human's shell — CI never loads this file, so nothing in the pipeline
may depend on one. The three shipped aliases are the three commands typed most;
the member aliases are generated from the same id list `setup:all`'s flags and
the `p:<id>:*` task group use.

**No secret-manager tool here.** The pinned capability provider ships its own
`[tools]` entry in `.config/mise/conf.d/<provider>.toml`, so swapping providers
never touches this file.

## `mise.ci.toml` — CI builds & deployed runtime

```toml
[settings]
# Install exactly what the tracked lockfiles record — one per config file that
# declares tools — and fail rather than resolve. A CI run that silently picks up
# a newer version is a build nobody can reproduce.
locked = true

# CI runs on Linux, where mise's bundled Node release-key gpg import can fail
# ("no valid OpenPGP data found"). Disable ONLY the Node signature check — the
# tarball is still SHA256-verified. Include this only for Node projects.
# node.gpg_verify = false

[tools]
# Usually empty — CI reuses the runtime from mise.toml. Add a tool here only if
# the pipeline genuinely needs it and dev does not.

[env]
# CI-only and PRODUCTION values for the keys mise.dev.toml names locally.
# NEVER a secret: tokens are injected by the CI provider or resolved by the
# pinned secret manager at run time. A value committed here is in the history.
```

## `mise.test.toml` — the test run

```toml
[tools]

[env]
# Deltas only. Layered on dev with MISE_ENV=dev,test, so everything a test needs
# that a dev shell already has must NOT be repeated here — only the keys whose
# value flips a runtime into its test mode.
# RUNTIME_ENV = "test"
```

## `mise.local.toml` — the machine, and nothing shipped

Never written by a pack, never committed, always gitignored — along with
`mise.<env>.local.toml`, the per-environment form. It is where a machine-specific
path, a personal project handle for the secret manager, or a locally built
runtime goes: anything true of one laptop and no other.

Its existence is documented in `mise.toml`'s banner rather than by a file,
because a shipped `mise.local.toml` would be committed by the first person who
ran `git add -A`.

## `conf.d/` — the tier a provider contributes to

mise auto-loads `.config/mise/conf.d/*.toml`. That is where a **capability
provider** puts its own `[tools]` pin and its `[env]` defaults —
`.config/mise/conf.d/<provider>.toml`, one file, owned end to end by the pack
that wrote it.

The point is removal as much as addition: swapping one secret manager for
another deletes one file and adds one, and `mise.toml` never changes. A provider
that edited the base instead would leave its keys behind on every uninstall.
