# Backing — OpenTelemetry · Grafana OTel-LGTM

The telemetry sink that needs no cloud: the product exports **OTLP** and an
OTel-LGTM stack terminates it, run wherever the product runs.

**The composition is stackgen's neutral observability contract plus this one
sink.** The contract requires only that leaving the backend never be a rewrite;
it names no protocol. What this bundle adds is the answer — the product emits
OTLP and never a vendor SDK, which makes the sink a destination rather than an
import, and makes the bundle replaceable by a managed backend without touching
a service. That guarantee is what picking it buys, not a law every product is
held to.

The constraint the product is built around is **cardinality**. Self-hosted it is
not a billing surprise but an outage: one metric label carrying a user id can
take the stack down before anyone reads a dashboard.

Full judgment: the component's own skill and its references. The contract it
cites is stackgen's observability contract.
