# Backing — OIDC issuer

Identity as an **open protocol** rather than a product: any issuer speaking
OpenID Connect, self-hosted or managed.

**The composition is stackgen's neutral identity contract plus this one
issuer.** The contract states what any provider must do — issue a verifiable
token, publish its keys, revoke, carry an account status, support the operator
plane. The `oidc` component states how the protocol does each, citing rather
than restating.

The constraint the product is built around is the **revocation window**: an
access token stays valid until it expires, which is the protocol working as
designed and is why verification can stay stateless. The window is a stated
product guarantee, not an implementation detail.

Full judgment: the component's own skill and its references. The contract it
cites is stackgen's identity contract.
