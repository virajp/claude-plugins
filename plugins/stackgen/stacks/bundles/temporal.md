# Backing — Temporal

Durable execution that needs no cloud: a workflow is ordinary code whose
progress is persisted, so a crash, a deploy or a week-long wait resumes where it
stopped.

**The composition is stackgen's neutral orchestration contract plus this one
engine.** The contract asks for the **smallest thing that holds** — and this is
the heaviest option on its ladder, justified only when a process has state
across steps and losing it halfway is unacceptable. One step retried until it
succeeds is a queue's job.

The constraint the product is built around is **determinism**: the workflow body
is replayed, so anything non-deterministic in it corrupts a resume, and changing
a workflow's shape breaks in-flight executions.

Full judgment: the component's own skill and its references. The contract it
cites is stackgen's orchestration contract.
