# Backing — PostgreSQL

The relational datastore that needs no cloud: an open engine, a managed
equivalent on every provider, and no lock-in beyond SQL itself.

**The composition is stackgen's neutral datastore contract plus this one
instance.** The contract states what any datastore must do — record
versioning, atomic multi-record writes, server-generated time, forward-only
migrations. The `postgres` component states how Postgres does each, **citing
the contract rather than restating it**, which is what lets a second datastore
be judged against the same clauses.

Access is services-only, and here that is a hard limit rather than a policy:
there is no client-direct path, so a flow whose blueprint assumes a client
subscription needs a different design.

Full judgment: the component's own skill and its references. The contract it
cites is stackgen's datastore contract.
