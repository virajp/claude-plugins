# Backing — fnox

The secrets manager you host yourself: a committed `fnox.toml` where each
secret is either encrypted in place (age, AWS KMS) or a reference into a
remote manager, and the two mix per secret. No vendor account, no per-seat
bill, nothing to reach at install time.

**The composition is stackgen's neutral secrets contract plus this one
manager.** The contract leads with the rule that outranks the rest — a secret
reaches a process as an environment variable, injected by a wrapper around the
repo's own task — which fnox satisfies without an SDK:
`fnox exec -- mise run <task>`, and nothing downstream knows fnox exists.

The axis this is chosen on is **where the secret lives, and what onboarding a
teammate costs**. Here: you hold them, onboarding is an age public key plus a
re-encrypt, and CI gets a decryption key. That is a different answer from a
hosted platform's, not a better one — the argument belongs in the component's
pick-and-trade reference, and neither the contract nor this bundle ranks them.

The constraint the product is built around is **permanent ciphertext**.
Re-keying changes what the next commit holds and nothing about what an
earlier one already published, so offboarding is a **rotation of every value**
rather than a re-encrypt — which means every secret has to be independently
rotatable, and a value whose compromise you could not survive belongs in
remote-reference mode instead.

Committing ciphertext is permitted under the contract's four encrypt-into-git
conditions, and this pack meets all four: the scanner allowlisted by path
only, no allowlist entry over a decryption identity, a pre-commit guard
proving the file holds no plaintext, and the file excluded from mining. Two of
those are repo-wide config edits the pack emits rather than advises, and the
guard it ships refuses a commit when any of them is missing.

**What it lands in the repo.** Its own config at the **repo root** — an
accepted exception to the rule that everything configurable lives under
`.config/`, because this tool discovers its config by walking up from the
working directory and a nested one would be found from some directories and
not others. Beside it, through the `config/` tier of stackgen's output
charter: an environment fragment under
`.config/mise/conf.d/`, which the toolchain manager auto-loads, and an
overlay of the manager's `setup/secrets` slot that verifies the tool is
reachable and reports the keychain prefix in use. A capability provider
**outranks every language and framework pack** in composition order, so its
overlay wins over anything one of them put in that slot; only a cloud
deploy target composes later still, and it writes different files. The
local override file is gitignored by the hygiene
pack, and the ciphertext guard this pack ships is what makes the
encrypt-into-git allowance safe rather than merely permitted.

Full judgment: the component's own skill and its references. The contract it
cites is stackgen's secrets contract.
