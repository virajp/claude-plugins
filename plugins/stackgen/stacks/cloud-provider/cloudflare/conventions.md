# Cloudflare — conventions

The provider half of the Cloud-Bundle: what holds across every Cloudflare
service the product uses, carried once so no service component restates it.

**The coverage here is deliberately narrow, and saying so is part of the
component.** This provider component exists to support **Zero Trust
Access**, **Workers Static Assets** and **Workers SSR** — a Worker with a
script in front of its own assets — and nothing else. Pages, R2, D1, KV,
Durable Objects, Queues, Images and Stream are planned under their own
effort and are **not offered** — a menu that comes back short without
explaining itself is indistinguishable from a broken one, so the shortfall
is stated rather than implied. Do not fill the gap from general Cloudflare
knowledge: a service this component has not written doctrine for is a
service it does not offer.

**Cloudflare hosts what it can serve from the edge and fronts everything
else.** At the scope offered here it hosts two shapes — a built directory
of files, on Workers Static Assets, and that directory with a script in
front of it, on Workers SSR — and for anything with a running process of a
kind the edge cannot hold, it fronts what runs on another cloud. That
second half inverts the usual reading of a Cloud-Bundle and is the single
fact most likely to be got wrong: a service or fullstack project pins its
hosting elsewhere and pairs the private plane with it, which is vwf's job,
and any cloud's own deploy bundle composes with it.

**The account is the unit of blast radius, and the roles are broader than
they look.** Grants are account-scoped, so a role handed out to edit one
application reaches every application in the account. `Cloudflare Access`
— which edits Access applications, policies and Tunnels — is the narrow
grant for this work; `Cloudflare Zero Trust` is administrator over every
Zero Trust product and is not the same request. Automation uses an
account-owned API token scoped to what it touches, never the Global API
Key, which is unscoped and carries the account.

**Billing follows the population, not the traffic.** A seat is consumed per
user allowed through, and it is freed by removing the user from the seat
rather than by their access expiring on its own. That shape is what makes
this cheap for an operator plane and the wrong answer for anything
customer-facing — the same conclusion the scoping rule reaches from the
other direction, and the reason offboarding is a billing event as well as a
security one.

**The private plane does not exist locally and must not be simulated.**
Cloudflare ships no emulator for the identity-aware proxy, and a local
stand-in would prove only that the stand-in works. Local runs reach the
project directly and inject the identity assertion as a fake through the
same seam the project already verifies in production.

Full judgment: the `cloudflare` skill and its references. The services this
provider carries are `cloud-service/zero-trust-access`,
`cloud-service/workers-static-assets` and `cloud-service/workers-ssr`.
