  Cloudflare as this product's private plane and as its static host — the
  account and role model behind least-privilege grants, seat-shaped billing
  and what frees a seat, what does and does not exist locally, and the
  networking rule that decides whether the private plane is real or
  decorative. Provider-wide judgment every Cloudflare service component —
  Zero Trust Access, Workers Static Assets and Workers SSR — cites rather
  than restates.

# Cloudflare

The provider-wide half of this stack: what holds across every Cloudflare
service, written once. This skill carries the judgment; the dashboard,
the API and `cloudflared`'s current flags belong to Context7 at use time.

Read the reference that matches what you are doing — one, not all of them.

| Doing | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Sizing, or explaining, a bill | [Cost doctrine](references/cost-doctrine.md) |
| Granting access to the account, or to automation | [Identity & IAM](references/identity-and-iam.md) |
| Running or testing the product on a laptop | [Local development map](references/local-development-map.md) |
| Making a project unreachable except through the proxy | [Networking & private plane](references/networking-and-private-plane.md) |

**Two rules that do not wait for a reference.** Cloudflare, at the scope
this stack offers, **hosts** two shapes — a built directory of files, on
Workers Static Assets, and that directory with a script in front of it, on
Workers SSR — and for anything with a running process the edge cannot hold
it **fronts** what runs elsewhere, where "elsewhere" is that project's
hosting pin's business and never this one's. And an origin that answers a
direct request is a private plane in name only; that failure is invisible
from the outside and is the subject of the networking reference.

## What this stack does not cover

Coverage is parked at **Zero Trust Access**, **Workers Static Assets** and
**Workers SSR**. Pages, R2, D1, KV, Durable Objects, Queues, Images and
Stream are planned under their own effort and are **not** part of this
stack. If the product needs one of them, that is a gap to name — not a gap
to fill from general Cloudflare knowledge, because doctrine nobody wrote
is doctrine nobody reviewed.
