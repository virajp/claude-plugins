# Cloudflare — local development map

Which of this provider's surfaces exist on a laptop, and what stands in
where none does.

## The map, at the scope this stack offers

| Surface | Locally |
| --- | --- |
| The identity-aware proxy | **Does not exist, and must not be simulated** |
| The identity assertion it passes | Injected as a fake through the project's own seam |
| Static assets on Workers | **Really runs** — `wrangler dev` serves the built directory |
| A Worker with a script on those assets | **Really runs** — the framework adapter's dev server executes it under the platform's own runtime, and `wrangler dev` serves the built output |
| Everything else Cloudflare sells | Out of this stack's scope entirely |

That is the whole map, and its shortness is the point rather than an
omission — see the scope fence in the `cloudflare` skill. Two rows of it
are a genuine local runtime rather than a stand-in, and they are the
exceptions: the asset server exercises the real routing rules, and where a
script is present the adapter's dev server runs it under `workerd` rather
than under Node, so the compatibility cliff shows up on the laptop instead
of at the edge. Their own fidelity traps — the edge, the custom domain, the
cache, the CPU ceiling — belong to the `workers-static-assets` and
`workers-ssr` components' local-dev references. The rest of this page is
about the proxy, which has no local existence at all.

## Why simulating the proxy is the wrong instinct

A local stand-in for an identity-aware proxy proves that the stand-in
works. It cannot prove the thing that actually breaks in production —
that the origin is unreachable except through the real proxy — because
locally the origin is deliberately reachable. So the fidelity is not
merely imperfect; it is inverted, asserting the opposite of the property
under test.

The consequence is worth stating plainly: **the private plane is verified
in a deployed environment or not at all.** A local suite that goes green
has said nothing about it. That is not a gap to close with more local
machinery; it is a fact about what local can mean here.

## What runs locally instead

Local runs **reach the project directly**, on its own port, with no proxy
in front. The project still verifies an identity assertion — it must,
because trusting a header is what makes one forgeable — so the assertion
is injected as a fake at the same seam production's real one arrives
through.

That seam is not something this stack introduces. The product's identity
contract already requires a boundary where an asserted identity becomes an
application principal; the fake goes there, and nothing else in the
project knows the difference. If no such seam exists, that is a finding
about the project rather than about this stack: without one, the fake has
to be threaded through application code, and code that special-cases
"local" is code that never runs in production.

## The fidelity trap

The fake is a fake. Two things it does not exercise, which a deployed
environment must:

- **The policy.** Whether the right group is allowed, and whether anyone
  else is, is decided by configuration the laptop never sees.
- **Assertion validation against real signing keys.** A fake the project
  minted for itself proves the parsing, not the trust. Verification
  against the issuer's published keys is a deployed-environment
  behaviour.

Both belong to the pre-production environment, which is why the service
component treats a staging credential as a requirement rather than a
convenience.
