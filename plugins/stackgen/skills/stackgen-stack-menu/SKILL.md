  packs plus the one open entry, generate-for-anything-uncovered — as a vwf
  menu payload. Invoked by /vwf:architecture and /vwf:setup when `stackgen` is
  listed in the config's `stacks:` — not a general-purpose skill.

# stackgen-stack-menu

Return the options this plugin offers, per the vwf stack-adapter contract.
**Return the payload and nothing else** — no prose, no recommendation, no
comparison. Choosing is the user's job and presenting the choice is vwf's.

> **`disable-model-invocation` must stay `false`, and `user-invocable` must
> stay `false` too.** A user-only skill is removed from the model's context
> entirely and cannot be invoked programmatically — vwf does not get an
> error, it gets an empty menu. And no user types this skill: it answers vwf
> in a payload shape only vwf reads, so it stays out of the `/` menu, which
> is shorter for it.

## How to answer

1. List `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/stacks/bundles/*.md`. **Each is one menu
   entry, except those whose frontmatter says `unconditional: true`** — a
   bundle is what a user picks, because a component answers "what is this
   language" and a bundle answers "what is a service in it". Its slug is the
   filename, and `name`, `axis`, `kind`, `platforms` and `artifact` come from
   the frontmatter (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/pack-format.md`). Take the
   `summary` from the body's opening sentence.

   **Skip every `unconditional: true` bundle.** Those are the repo baseline —
   one pack per slot, where a one-entry menu is theatre and where a repo that
   has picked no stack still needs the thing. `/vwf:init` materializes them
   by **fixed slug** — `mise`, `repo-gates` and `repo-hygiene` — never a slug
   constructed from configuration, and never through this menu. Listing one
   here would offer a choice that is not one, and would let a user decline a
   baseline nothing else can supply.

   **Never list bare components.** `stacks/<type>/<slug>/pack.yaml` files are
   the parts a bundle composes, not options — offering them would ask the user
   to assemble a stack rather than choose one.
2. Return the payload below. The `generate` block is present on **every**
   answer — it is the open entry, and it is what makes an empty pack list read
   as a decision rather than a fault.

```yaml
plugin: stackgen
note: Packs listed here are curated and copied verbatim. Any technology no
  pack covers can be GENERATED — pin `generated/<technology-slug>` on the
  axis that needs it, and the first template fetch runs the generation
  pipeline (researched via Context7, instantiated against vwf's principles
  catalog, gated by review and your consent) directly into the repo's
  committed .claude/ tree. Generation needs Context7 reachable and halts
  without it.
templates:
  - slug: <bundle filename without .md>
    axis: <bundle frontmatter axis>
    kind: <bundle frontmatter kind> # assets/kinds.md
    platforms: [ <platform> ] # project axis only
    name: <display name>
    summary: <one line>
generate:
  pin: generated/<technology-slug>
  axes: [ project, backing, deploy, repo, design, cicd ]
  kinds: [ language-bundle, database, cloud-provider, repo-gate, capability-provider, ci-system, app-framework, deploy-target, design-tool ] # the generatable kinds
  summary: Generate principles-grounded skills and conventions for any stack
    no pack covers. Explicit, reviewed, consent-gated — never a silent run.
```

**`kinds:` omits `toolchain-manager`, `repo-hygiene` and `workspace`
deliberately**, and the omission is a recorded decision rather than an
oversight — an unstated gap here reads as one either way, which is why it is
written down. None of the three is generatable **today**:

- **`toolchain-manager`** — making the task runner genuinely pickable is
  explicitly deferred. vwf still names `mise run` directly rather than
  reaching a task through the manager the repo pinned, so there is no
  uncovered tail to generate into: a generated manager would be a second
  vocabulary nothing calls.
- **`repo-hygiene`** — there is no uncovered tail. The kind's whole content
  is the files every repo has regardless of what it is written in, which one
  pack covers by definition; the only per-stack part is the ignore sections,
  and those are appended from the community templates at init time rather
  than generated. A generated second hygiene pack would be a second
  `.gitignore` opinion for the same repo.
- **`workspace`** — newly minted. Generating one is untested capability, not
  preserved capability, and the open entry is a promise about the former
  only. Its three curated bundles cover the pnpm and bun shapes; an uncovered
  workspace ecosystem is a bundle to author, not a run to offer.

Both are `kinds.md` kinds regardless, and both may be added here once the
condition above stops holding.

**If no pickable bundle remains** — `stacks/bundles/` is empty, or every file
in it is `unconditional: true` — **return `templates: []`** with the same
`note` and `generate` block — the open entry is what makes an empty list read as a
decision rather than a fault.

**A bundle whose components are partly `@generated` is listed normally**, with
no warning and no asterisk. Mixing copied and generated components is the
dispatch rule working, and the lockfile records which was which; flagging it in
the menu would present a routine outcome as a defect.

## Rules

- **Packs are exhaustive; generation is the only open door.** Never invent a
  pack entry, and never present generation as if it were a curated pack — the
  trust level differs and the user is choosing between them.
- Do not read the repo, the registry, or `.config/vwf.yaml`. This skill
  answers the same way in every product; the dispatch happens in
  `/stackgen:stackgen-stack-template`, not here.
