# stackgen-sync

The explicit re-sync. Everything stackgen materializes is **repo-owned** —
copies the project may edit, that a pack upgrade must never overwrite
silently. This skill is the one place drift becomes visible and the user
decides what to take, and it works **per component**: one component's drift
or upgrade never churns the rest of its bundle. It is user-only by design:
nothing invokes it programmatically, so a sync only ever happens on the
user's clock.

## Steps

1. **Inventory, from the lockfile.** Read `.claude/stackgen/lock.yaml`
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/output-tree.md`). No lockfile → report
   "nothing materialized" and stop. The lockfile is the whole inventory:
   a path it does not list is the repo's own and is invisible to this
   skill. Partition entries by **component** (every landing carries its
   component ref) and by source: pack-sourced vs `generated`. Read the
   `settings_keys`, `mcp_servers` and `local_plugin` blocks too — those
   name state outside `.claude/`, and each diffs on its own terms below.

   **Entries are not all under `.claude/`.** A component may have landed
   repo config files from its `config/` tree — the toolchain manager's
   layers and task library, a gate's own config file, the hygiene files at
   the repo root, a provider's `.config/mise/conf.d/` fragment, a
   `.config/pre-commit.d/` hook fragment, a `.config/vscode.d/` editor
   fragment, a deploy target's root config — and those are ordinary
   lockfile entries carrying a `path`, a `component`, a `hash` and a
   `mode`. Inventory them with the rest; they differ only in where they sit
   and in the consent line they take. What may sit at the repo **root** is
   the allowlist in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/output-tree.md`, which is
   the one statement of it — never re-list it here.

2. **Diff pack-sourced components.** For each component, re-derive its
   landing set from the current pack
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/stacks/<type>/<slug>/`, per
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/pack-format.md`) and classify each file by
   hash against the lockfile and the tree — three states, reported per
   file: **unchanged**, **pack moved** (the pack's version/content changed,
   the copy still matches its landing hash), **repo edited** (the copy no
   longer matches its landing hash — whether or not the pack also moved).
   A pack that no longer exists in this stackgen version is reported, never
   deleted.

   A component's `config/` files diff on **exactly these terms** — same
   three states, same hashes, same per-component grain — with two things
   to carry through. **Mode is part of the file**: a
   `.config/mise/tasks/**` entry recorded `755` and now sitting 644 is a
   drift worth reporting, because mise reports a non-executable task file
   as an *unknown task* rather than as a permission error, and
   `mise run init` is the restore. And where two components write into
   one tree, re-derive in composition order — `toolchain-manager`, then
   `toolchain-gate`, then `repo-hygiene`, then `package-manager` /
   `language`, then `app-framework`, then `capability-provider`, then
   `cloud-provider`, then `cloud-service`, later
   wins — and diff each file against the component
   the lockfile says supplied it. A
   file whose supplying component **changed** is a real delta, reported
   as such: it means precedence moved, not that the pack did.

   **`.config/pre-commit-config.yaml` is diffed outside its markers
   only.** The fragments a pack ships land as
   `.config/pre-commit.d/<pack>.yaml` files and are diffed there, like any
   other entry; the merged config is `/vwf:init`'s output, and the regions
   between its `# >>>` and `# <<<` markers are re-merged by init rather
   than reconciled here. So compare the file **around** those regions and
   report drift there; never rewrite inside them, and never treat a
   fragment that has moved as a reason to edit the merged file — say the
   fragment moved and that a re-run of init is what folds it in. Two
   things writing between the same markers is the one way this file could
   lose an edit.

3. **Offer regeneration per generated component.** A `generated` component
   has no pack to diff against; offer to re-run the generator for that
   component alone (the pipeline in `/stackgen:stackgen-stack-template`'s
   references — fresh research against its recorded citations, reviewer
   gate included) and diff its output against the repo's copy. Skip any
   component the user declines — regeneration costs research and review; it
   is an offer, not a default, and taking one component never forces
   another.

4. **Diff the local plugin, if the lockfile has one.** No `local_plugin`
   block → skip this step entirely; this repo has never written to the
   machine and a sync must not start. Otherwise read
   `~/.claude/plugins/local/stackgen-lsp/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
   compare, **key by key and only for the keys this repo claims** under
   `local_plugin.lsp_servers` / `local_plugin.mcp_servers`
   (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/stackgen-stack-template/references/local-plugin.md`
   is the procedure — the merge classification, the version bump and the
   removal path):

   - a claimed key whose declaration the current pack has changed —
     **offer** the update;
   - a claimed key the manifest no longer holds — report it; the user
     removed it by hand and re-adding it uninvited is exactly the silent
     write this skill exists to prevent;
   - a claimed key whose component is no longer in the composition —
     offer **removal by subtraction**, which drops that key alone and
     touches no other repo's;
   - a key the manifest holds that this repo does not claim — invisible
     here, always. It is another repo's, or the user's.

   Everything in this step is **outside the repo and outside the commit**;
   only the `local_plugin` block moves with the lockfile.

5. **Present the delta for consent.** One consolidated dry-run plan,
   grouped **per component**: every file that would change, with its
   three-state classification. **Repo edits are never overwritten by
   default** — a *repo edited* file is taken only if the user picks it
   explicitly, and the default selection covers only *pack moved* files.
   Three things get their **own** consent lines rather than riding the
   file plan, and each is separately declinable:

   - any change to entries under `settings_keys` — a
     `.claude/settings.json` edit, and **settings.json is never modified
     without explicit consent**;
   - any change to entries under the top-level `mcp_servers` — a
     `.mcp.json` edit, on the same terms;
   - any change to a `config/`-tier entry — a write **outside
     `.claude/`**, into files the repo's collaborators own and read, so it
     is its own **tier-2** line listing every path, on the same
     merges-never-owns terms: only the paths this lockfile records are
     updated or removed, and a declined line leaves the `.claude/` side
     landed and says the tasks stay as they are;
   - anything from step 4 — the **tier-3** line, which says plainly that
     it writes to this machine outside the repo, and where a
     registration or de-registration is involved **prints the `claude`
     commands and asks; it never runs them unprompted**.

   Nothing selected → done, nothing written.

6. **Apply and commit.** Write only what was selected, update the changed
   components' lockfile hashes and the `local_plugin` block, and commit as
   one commit via the repo's git workflow. The local plugin's own files
   are on the machine, not in the commit.

## Rules

- **Visible, never silent** — every write traces to a line the user saw in
  the delta.
- **The component is the grain.** A framework's major bump regenerates that
  framework component alone; the language baseline beside it is untouched
  unless its own pack moved.
- **The lockfile is the boundary**, and it is the boundary **outside**
  `.claude/` too: a `.config/` file stackgen did not materialize is the
  repo's own and is never diffed, updated or removed, however exactly its
  path matches something a pack ships. Nothing in the repo is ever
  deleted without a line the user picked — a retired pack's copies stay
  until the user removes them.
- **Mode travels with a `config/` file.** Write back the recorded mode
  when a task file is taken; a `.config/mise/tasks/**` file restored 644
  is a task that has disappeared as far as mise is concerned.
- **The local plugin is the one thing subtracted rather than left.** It is
  the machine's shared file, not a repo copy, so a stale key there is
  another repo's problem rather than a note the user can ignore. Removal
  drops only the keys this repo's lockfile claims; the directory and the
  registration go only when subtracting leaves no servers at all, and only
  after the user confirms the two printed commands.
