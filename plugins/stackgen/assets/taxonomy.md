# Component Taxonomy

stackgen's unit is the **component** — the atom a stack is actually made
of: `typescript`, `pnpm`, `axum`, `postgres`, `kafka`, `cloud-run`. One
pack per component (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/pack-format.md`); a
**bundle** is never a directory — it is a recorded composition of component
refs in the template payload. This file is the closed vocabulary that
classifies every component, curated and generated alike. It is **extended
deliberately**: a new type or category is an edit to this file, reviewed
like any contract change — never a value a generation run invents because
nothing here fit.

Every component declares up to three classification fields in its metadata:
**`type`** always, **`category`** where its type has categories, and
**`capability`** where the component realizes a vwf capability.

## Component types

The closed list. A component is exactly one of:

- **`language`** — a programming language; the root a Language-Bundle
  composes around, and the one type that carries the per-language facts
  `/vwf:doctor` verifies (LSP provision, mise tool, manifest).
- **`package-manager`** — how a language's dependencies are installed and
  locked; contributes the `repo`-axis facts.
- **`framework`** — a library that imposes structure inside a language: a
  webserver, an ORM, a testing framework, a meta-framework. Note the
  containment: a `framework` is **subordinate** to the `language` component
  it composes with.
- **`app-framework`** — the inversion of that containment: an SDK that owns
  the manifest, the build and the project layout, and **decides which
  languages appear**. Flutter is the case that forced this type — its
  `pubspec.yaml` declares both the Dart and Flutter SDK constraints and
  configures the *iOS* package manager, its build drives Gradle and Xcode
  rather than the reverse, and its scaffolder takes the native language as a
  flag. A type is warranted where the SDK is what a project pins and the
  language is what the SDK brought.
- **`toolchain-gate`** — a repo-level gate: formatter, linter, secret
  scanner, vulnerability scanner, hook runner.
- **`toolchain-manager`** — the repo's developer toolchain manager, doing
  three jobs: it **pins** the tool versions the repo runs on, **holds** the
  environment values those tools and tasks read, and **runs** the repo's
  tasks. Distinct from the `toolchain-gate`, which *is* one gate — a
  manager gates nothing and runs the gates instead. Distinct from the
  `build-orchestrator`, which schedules work across a workspace's packages
  with caching and dependency ordering; a manager is a flat task namespace,
  and an orchestrator typically runs beneath it. Distinct from the
  `package-manager`, which installs and locks a *language's dependencies*
  rather than tools. A component that does only one of the three jobs — a
  pinner that runs nothing, a task runner that pins nothing — records the
  others `n/a`; contributes the `repo`-axis facts.
- **`repo-hygiene`** — the files a repository carries **whatever it is
  written in**: the ignore set, the editor and attribute defaults, the
  licence and the security contact, and the dependency-update policy. Not a
  gate — it checks nothing and fails nothing; it is the ground the gates run
  over, which is why folding it into `toolchain-gate` would have put a
  licence file behind a scanner's doctrine. Exactly one per repo, and it
  realizes no vwf capability: there is no seam here, because nothing in a
  blueprint chooses an `.editorconfig`.
- **`cloud-provider`** — a provider itself: the account/IAM/billing and
  emulator judgment that spans its services.
- **`cloud-service`** — one service of one provider: a compute target, a
  managed database, a managed queue.
- **`datastore`** — a datastore the product runs against, standing on its
  own rather than as one cloud's flavour.
- **`queue`** — a standalone queue or event bus.
- **`capability-provider`** — the flavour half of a vwf capability that
  belongs to no cloud and is not a datastore: an identity issuer, a
  telemetry sink, a workflow engine, a secrets manager. Its **category**
  says which.
- **`ci-system`** — one continuous-integration system: where its workflows
  live, how it is triggered, and how it installs a toolchain. One component
  per system, never per workflow.
- **`build-orchestrator`** — task and build orchestration across a workspace's
  packages: caching, dependency-ordered runs. Distinct from the
  `package-manager`, which installs and locks but does not schedule work.
- **`deploy-target`** — where a built artifact lands when the target belongs to
  no cloud: a package registry, a provider-neutral container host. A cloud's own
  compute service stays a `cloud-service`.
- **`cdn`** — a content-delivery layer.
- **`design-tool`** — the tool a project's screens and design system are
  authored in. Selected by the project's `design:` pin rather than composed
  into anything, which is why it is its own type: it sits beside a stack
  rather than inside one, and two projects on the same stack routinely use
  different ones.

## Categories

The finer cut, closed per type. A type absent here has no categories yet,
and its components leave `category` unset.

- **`framework`**: `webserver` / `orm` / `otel-sdk` / `testing` /
  `meta-framework` / `ui-library` / `cli` / `iac` / `workflow-sdk` /
  `agent-sdk`
- **`cloud-service`**: `compute` / `sql` / `document` / `queue` /
  `object-storage` / `cdn` / `static-hosting` / `access` / `identity` /
  `messaging` / `key-value` / `stateful-compute` / `orchestration` /
  `database-proxy` / `vector` / `ingestion` / `analytics` /
  `inference` / `ai-gateway` / `retrieval` / `browser` / `media` /
  `realtime` / `secrets-manager`
- **`datastore`**: `sql` / `document` / `graph` / `vector` / `key-value` /
  `in-memory`
- **`capability-provider`**: `identity` / `telemetry` / `workflow` /
  `secrets-manager`
- **`app-framework`**: `cross-platform-ui` / `native-ui`

A name appearing as both a type and a category is deliberate, not a
collision: `kafka` is type `queue` (a standalone component); a provider's
pub/sub service is type `cloud-service`, category `queue`. The shared
category is what makes them substitutable answers to the same blueprint
capability — and what lets a stack menu become a category-filtered query
rather than a per-plugin list.

## The capability seam

Capability tokens are **vwf's** — defined in vwf's capability-vocabulary
asset, blueprint-neutral, referenced here by token and never redefined. The
category taxonomy is **stackgen's** — the cut beneath the capability that
vwf never sees. vwf never learns what an ORM is; stackgen never redefines
what `relational-datastore` means. A component's `capability` field names
the vwf token it realizes: a `datastore`/`sql` component realizes
`relational-datastore`; a `queue` component `message-queue` or `pub-sub`.
The cloud side reads the same way: a `cloud-service`/`key-value`
component realizes `cache-layer`, `vector` realizes `search-index`,
`orchestration` realizes `durable-workflows`, and `messaging` realizes
whichever channel token the service actually is — `email`,
`push-notifications` or `sms`.

Some categories have **no capability token today** — `cdn`,
`secrets-manager`, `access`, `static-hosting`, `stateful-compute`,
`database-proxy`, `ingestion`, `analytics`, `inference`, `ai-gateway`,
`retrieval`, `browser`, `media` and `realtime`. That is a known vwf-side
gap, not a taxonomy error: the component leaves `capability` unset, and
nothing here mints a token to fill the hole — minting capabilities is
vwf's move. It is also why a category can exist here before vwf has
decided whether every product must have one: the taxonomy classifies what
a component *is*, never whether it is required.

Fourteen `cloud-service` tokens and one `framework` token (`agent-sdk`)
were minted on 2026-09-06 for the Cloudflare developer platform.
`stateful-compute` is deliberately not `object-storage`: a per-key
durable object is compute that keeps state, so pick-and-trade must not
line it up against a blob store or ask it to satisfy a blob-storage
contract it cannot meet. And `secrets-manager` now sits under both
`cloud-service` and `capability-provider` on purpose — the first names
the runtime secrets binding a hosted service reads, the second the
developer-machine and CI secrets provider; they share a noun and neither
replaces the other.

## Bundles — how types compose

A bundle is rooted per kind (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/kinds.md`):

- A **Language-Bundle** is the composition rooted at a `language`
  component: the language + its `package-manager`, `framework` components
  and `toolchain-gate`s.
- A **Cloud-Bundle** is a `cloud-provider` component + `cloud-service`
  components.
- A **Datastore-Bundle** is category-level doctrine + an instance
  component (a `datastore`, or a cloud's `cloud-service`/`sql`).
- A **Capability-Bundle** is category-level doctrine — the neutral capability
  contract — plus one `capability-provider` component that realizes it, the
  same halves a Datastore-Bundle is built from.
- An **App-Bundle** is rooted at an `app-framework` component, which carries
  its languages **as members with a role** rather than composing into one of
  them: one `primary` language and any number of `platform-edge` languages,
  which exist only at the SDK's native boundary. This is the one bundle whose
  root is not the thing its languages would suggest.
- A **CI-Bundle** is the release-trigger contract plus exactly one
  `ci-system` component, on the **`cicd`** axis. The contract is the
  mechanism half vwf's delivery-pipeline rules deliberately leave open, so
  it sits where a capability contract sits in every other pairing. Never
  two components: a repo has one pipeline, and generating for a system the
  repo does not use is how a second, unmaintained pipeline appears.
- A **Deploy-Bundle** is exactly one `deploy-target` component and nothing
  else. It is the only bundle with no second half, because there is no
  category above a provider-neutral target to write doctrine at — a target
  that belongs to a cloud is a `cloud-service` inside a Cloud-Bundle
  instead. What keeps the single component honest is its kind's scope
  fence rather than a pairing.
- A **Design-Bundle** is exactly one `design-tool` component, standing alone
  like a Deploy-Bundle, on the **`design`** axis.

Those last two share a property nothing else here has, and it is what makes the
**tool axes** (`design`, `cicd`) cheap: **the bundle slug is the tool token the
project config already holds**. Picking from the menu and writing
`projects.<name>.design` are one act rather than two that can disagree. They
exist because a template no menu can offer is not an error — it is invisible,
which is how a CI-system pack shipped that nothing could ever materialize.
- A **Repo-Gate-Bundle** is the `toolchain-gate` components that apply to
  the whole repository rather than to one toolchain in it — one of the four
  compositions rooted at the `repo` axis. A gate meaningful for exactly one
  toolchain is **not** here: it belongs to that language's bundle, which is
  what keeps a polyglot repo from materializing the same scanner once per
  language.
- A **Toolchain-Manager-Bundle** is exactly one `toolchain-manager`
  component, also on the **`repo`** axis. Like a Deploy-Bundle it has no
  second half — there is no category above the manager to write doctrine at
  — and like a CI-Bundle it is **exactly one**: a repo with two task
  runners has two vocabularies for the same commands, and only one of them
  is the one anything else invokes.
- A **Repo-Hygiene-Bundle** is exactly one `repo-hygiene` component,
  standing alone like a Deploy-Bundle — the third composition on the
  **`repo`** axis, and the newest. There is no second half because there is
  no category above "the files every repo has" to write doctrine at, and the
  fence that keeps it honest is its kind's scope rather than a pairing.
- A **Workspace-Bundle** is the `package-manager` component that installs
  and locks the repo's members plus a `build-orchestrator` component where
  the repo has one — the fourth composition on the **`repo`** axis, and the
  only one of the four a user picks: `repo.stack.template` is what selects
  it, while the other three are `unconditional:` baselines. A single-package
  repo pins none, which is the edge rather than a gap. The
  `package-manager` component appears in two kinds' compositions the way
  `toolchain-gate` does — it carries `language-bundle` topics 7–8 there and
  the multi-member half here, so its own `kind:` naming `language-bundle`
  is the seam working rather than a mis-declared pack.

## Category-level doctrine

Doctrine that belongs to a category rather than an instance is written
**once**, as stackgen curated knowledge under
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/contracts/<area>.md`. Instance components cite
it and stay thin: the `postgres` pack carries what is Postgres's alone.

The contracts are **capability-neutral by construction** — each states what
*any* provider must satisfy without naming one, and names the vwf capability
tokens it realizes, or that its category has none yet (`contracts/secrets.md`
is the first of those). That is what lets two providers in one category be
compared against the same clauses instead of against each other's marketing.

Two files there are **not** capability contracts, and each is marked as such
in its own opening line. `contracts/local-stack.md` states the mechanism
behind vwf's `local_stack` **harness** capability;
`contracts/release-trigger.md` states the mechanism behind the `ci-system`
**kind**, which vwf's delivery-pipeline rules leave open on purpose. Both
earn the same directory for the same reason — doctrine above the instance
that several components would otherwise each restate — but neither is
*chosen* by a component, so neither names a provider or realizes a
capability token.
