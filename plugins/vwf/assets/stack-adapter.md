# Stack Adapter Contract

vwf is **decoupled from any particular technology**. It ships no stack
templates, names no language, framework, datastore, cloud, or test runner, and
cannot: every concrete technology lives in a **stack plugin**, and vwf exchanges
**normalized payloads** with whichever ones the product configured.

This is the same shape as the design-adapter contract
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/design-adapter.md`), applied to the stack.

## What vwf keeps, and what it delegates

| vwf owns (abstract)                                                 | A stack plugin owns (concrete)                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| The **six axes** (`project` / `backing` / `deploy` / `design` / `cicd` per project, `repo` per repo) | Which templates exist on each axis             |
| The **template frontmatter contract** (`stack-vocabulary.md`)       | The templates themselves                                    |
| The **platform** vocabulary a project template declares             | Which platforms it offers a template for                    |
| Harness **capability names** (`dev`, `e2e_local`, `screenshots`, …) | What *satisfies* each one — the tool, the task, the command |
| The **UX gate's contract** (render changed screens, judge, report)  | How rendering and a11y assertion are actually done          |
| `.config/vwf.yaml`'s `stack` block shape                            | The values that land in it                                  |

The rule that decides every case: **vwf states the requirement, the plugin
states the mechanism.** vwf says a UI slice must have its screens rendered and
scanned; it must never say "Playwright" or "golden tests". If a vwf file names a
tool, that naming is a bug in this contract.

### The two deliberate exceptions

Both are **recognition, not prescription** — vwf naming a tool in order to read
someone else's repo, never to tell them what to use. Any third case is a bug.

1. **This paragraph.** The rule cannot be stated without an example of what it
   forbids.
2. **The `readme` skill's scan lists.** It documents a repo it did not choose,
   so it has to recognise what is already there. The lists are open-ended and
   carry no preference; a tool absent from them is a gap in recognition, not a
   verdict on the tool.

Everything else that reads a repo — topology detection, harness detection —
resolves through the installed stack plugins instead. A signal no plugin claims
is recorded as `unknown`, which lets a **scan** finish on its other evidence but
is a **blocking** finding the moment vwf is asked to plan or build: the menu is
closed to what the installed plugins define
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-vocabulary.md`).

## Configuration

Two different things are configured, at two different scopes, and conflating
them is the mistake this section exists to prevent.

**Which plugins to ask** is product-wide — the roster vwf unions the menus of:

```yaml
# .config/vwf.yaml
stacks: [ stackgen ] # ADAPTER PLUGIN NAMES, verbatim
```

An ordered list of plugin names. Every name must be an installed plugin —
`stacks: [ stackgen ]` means the `stackgen` plugin must be installed. Order is the menu
order; it carries no precedence, because the axes do not overlap. A **dependent**
plugin does not need its dependency listed: a plugin declaring another in its own
manifest is installed with it. List what the product chose, not the closure.

**What each project picked** is per project, and lives in the project's own
`stack` block (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/vwf-config.md`):

```yaml
projects:
  website:
    stack:
      template: project/site/<slug>
      backing_template: [ <slug>, <slug> ]
      deploy_template: [ <slug> ]
  api:
    stack:
      template: project/service/<slug>
      backing_template: [ <slug> ]
      deploy_template: [ <slug>, <slug> ] # a project may ship through several
  cli:
    stack:
      template: unresolved # deferred — see below
      backing_template: []
      deploy_template: unresolved
```

Since **config_format 13** the `backing` and `deploy` axes are per project, not
product-wide. That is what lets one product run its site on one cloud and its
API on another while both draw from the same installed plugins: the roster is
shared, the selections are not. A product-wide `backing:` or `deploy:` block is
`12` drift.

Since **config_format 16** `deploy_template` is a **list**, matching
`backing_template`: a project ships through as many delivery mechanisms as it has
— a package registry, a container image, a signed archive — and a scalar could
record one. Adapters that emit a deploy payload are unaffected; the cardinality
is the *config's*, and each slug is still fetched on its own.

Since **config_format 16** any axis may also read **`unresolved`** — deferred,
not decided (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/vwf-config.md`, "The three axis
states"). It is the bare scalar even on the list axes, and it is never something
an adapter returns: it records that vwf did not ask, or that the user postponed
the answer. **No adapter is invoked for an unresolved axis**, so a stack plugin
never sees the value and needs no handling for it.

The `repo` axis stays per repo (`repo.stack.template`) — it describes the
checkout, not a project.

## The delegation protocol

vwf invokes skills on each configured plugin, at **exactly** these names:

| Skill                                      | Kind   | Returns                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `/<plugin>:<plugin>-stack-menu`            | data   | a **menu payload**          |
| `/<plugin>:<plugin>-stack-template <slug>` | data   | a **template payload**      |
| the repo's own `ux-gate` skill             | action | **UX findings** (UI stacks) |

So `stacks: [ stackgen ]` resolves to `/stackgen:stackgen-stack-menu`. vwf constructs every
name from the configured value — nothing is looked up or guessed.

**The catalog handover.** Every `-stack-template` invocation passes the
principles-catalog asset paths
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/principles/index.md` and its entries) alongside
the slug — the design-adapter payload style: vwf hands its own asset paths
into the invocation, and no plugin ever reaches into vwf's files. A curated
plugin ignores them; a **generating** adapter (the materialized-template
variant below) requires them, and halts by contract when they are missing
rather than substituting general knowledge.

**Why the name repeats the plugin.** OpenCode installs skills into one flat
namespace, so two plugins declaring `stack-menu` would overwrite each other;
Claude Code namespaces a skill by its plugin, so a bare name need only be unique
inside its own bundle. The `<plugin>-` prefix on every adapter skill name is
therefore readability rather than a correctness requirement — keep it, because a
menu skill called `stack-menu` tells a reader nothing about whose menu it is.

### Every adapter skill MUST be model-invocable

That is `disable-model-invocation: false` in the skill's frontmatter. The single
most important rule here, and getting it wrong fails **silently**:
`disable-model-invocation: true` removes the skill from the model's context
entirely and blocks programmatic invocation — so a delegated call does not error.
vwf simply cannot see the skill, and the menu comes back empty. A stack plugin
whose skills are user-only is indistinguishable, at runtime, from one with no
templates. `p:plugins:check` enforces it.

### vwf preflights, because the failure mode is silence

Before delegating, `/vwf:architecture`, `/vwf:setup` and `/vwf:doctor` **verify
every plugin named in `stacks:` is installed** (`claude plugin list`). They do
not attempt the call and infer from the result — that inference is impossible. A
missing plugin is a **halt** with the install command, never an empty menu.

## The menu payload

Returned by `-stack-menu`. One entry per template the plugin offers:

```yaml
plugin: <name>
templates:
  - slug: <kebab> # unique within the plugin
    axis: project | backing | deploy | repo | design | cicd
    platforms: [ <platform> ] # PROJECT AXIS ONLY — which registry platforms this template serves
    name: <display name> # what the menu shows
    summary: <one line> # why you would pick it
```

vwf renders the union of every configured plugin's menu, grouped by axis and
(for the project axis) filtered to the **platforms** being decided. It never
reads a template file.

**`platforms:` is a list, and that is the point.** Since blueprint format 22 a
project declares one `role` and one or more platforms, and a single template
routinely serves several of them: one Flutter template covers `mobile`,
`tablet`, `desktop` and `webapp` from one codebase; one server template covers
`service` and `webapp` — what the retired `fullstack` role meant. The previous
contract keyed a template on a single `role`, stored in three places (the
directory name, the frontmatter and this payload), and could not express either
case.

**The covering rule.** A project pins **one** project-axis template, and that
template's `platforms:` must **cover** every platform the project declares in
the registry. `/vwf:architecture` offers only covering
templates; `/vwf:doctor` reports a pin that stopped covering as
**blocking**, since `plan` and `execute` would otherwise size a surface against
conventions written for something else. Nothing checked this before, because a
single-role pin had nothing to check.

**A template's own directory is not the source.** A template's platforms come
from its payload, not from any directory.

### The two tool axes — `design` and `cicd`

Added after a stranded pack made the gap visible: a CI-system template existed
that **no menu could offer**, because CI is chosen by a per-project config key
rather than by a stack pin, and the menu is the only door a template can come
through. A template nothing can offer is not an error — it is invisible, which
is why it shipped unnoticed.

These two axes close that door, making six axes in all. They differ from the
other four in one respect worth stating, because it is what keeps them cheap:

**The slug *is* the config value.** `projects.<name>.design` and
`projects.<name>.cicd` already hold a tool token — `claude-design`,
`github-actions` — and a menu entry on these axes takes that same token as its
slug. So there is exactly one value, written once, and no second spelling to
drift against. `/vwf:doctor` reports a pin resolving to no menu entry the same
way it reports any other unresolvable pin.

Neither axis takes `platforms:`. `design` is required for a project declaring
any **screen** platform and absent otherwise (the same condition the config key
already states); `cicd` is required for a project the pipeline builds.

**`design` is where the design adapter's per-tool knowledge now comes from.**
vwf still names no tool: the adapter contract
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/design-adapter.md`) defines the payloads and the
three fixed skill names, and the pinned template materializes the resolved
tool's implementation of them into the repo's own `.claude/`.

## The template payload

Returned by `-stack-template <slug>` once the user picks. Carries what
`.config/vwf.yaml` records plus what `plan` and `execute` need to work:

```yaml
slug: <kebab>
axis: project | backing | deploy | repo | design | cicd
languages: [ <token> ] # open; the plugin owning the language defines its facts
optional_languages: []
frameworks: [] # open, lowercase-kebab
dependencies: [] # open, lowercase-kebab
capabilities: [] # backing axis — capability-vocabulary.md tokens
artifact: <token> # deploy axis
package_manager: <token> # repo axis
harness: # HOW this stack satisfies each capability
  <capability>: { task: <name>, mechanism: <one line> } # or `n/a`
conventions: <prose> # layout, testing, placement — read by plan/execute
```

The `harness` block is what replaces the tool names vwf used to carry. vwf asks
"can this repo run `screenshots`?"; the plugin answers "yes — task `test:e2e`,
via a browser driver". `/vwf:doctor` checks the task exists; it never checks
*which* tool.

### Resolving the conventions

`.config/vwf.yaml` records **which** templates a project picked; it does not
record what they say. The `conventions:` prose — layout, testing, placement — is
the template's, and reaching it means asking the plugin. `/vwf:plan` sizes its
steps against that prose and `/vwf:execute` writes code to it, so both resolve
it the same way:

1. **Collect the pins** for every project in scope — `template`, each
   `backing_template` entry, each `deploy_template` entry (a list since
   `config_format` 16), and the repo's `repo.stack.template`. Skip `n/a` and an
   empty list; both are answers, not pins.

   **An `unresolved` axis halts here, before any fetch.** It is the one state
   that is neither a pin nor an answer, so there is no prose to resolve and no
   honest way to proceed — report the project and the axis, point at
   `/vwf:architecture`, and stop. Distinguish it from the failure below when
   reporting: this one is a question nobody answered, not a plugin that broke.
2. **Dedupe by (plugin, slug) and fetch each once**, calling
   `/<plugin>:<plugin>-stack-template <slug>`. A monorepo whose projects share a
   repo template fetches it once, not once per project.
3. **Resolve once per run, before the work starts**, and pass the result down to
   every subagent that needs it. Re-fetching per element or per step would
   re-pay the call for prose that cannot change mid-run.

**A fetch that fails is a halt, not a degrade.** By this point the stack gate has
already confirmed every pin names a template an installed plugin ships, so a
failure here is the plugin being unreachable or returning garbage — an
infrastructure fault, not a config one. Report it with the slug and stop.
Continuing would produce exactly what the closed menu exists to prevent: a run
sized and written against conventions nobody read, indistinguishable from one
where the conventions happened to say nothing.

**The prose informs code, never the contract.** These conventions reach
`docs/plans/` and the repo's source. They never reach `docs/blueprint/` — that is
the line that keeps a vendor name structurally impossible in a blueprint doc
rather than merely discouraged, and it is why the stack lives in config in the
first place.

## The materialized-template variant

A stack plugin may be a **materializer** rather than a library: instead of
serving templates from its own tree forever, it lands them — skills, agents,
hooks, rules, and the template payload itself — **directly in the repo's
committed `.claude/` tree**, recorded in a lockfile the plugin owns, on an
explicit, consent-gated first pin. The repo owns the copies; the plugin's
own settings edits (hook wiring) take separate explicit consent, and the
repo's CLAUDE.md stays vwf's domain — the materializer ends by recommending
`/vwf:setup`. The `stackgen` plugin is this variant's implementation; vwf's
side of the contract is three rules:

- **The payload may carry `language_facts`** — per language, the facts a
  language plugin would otherwise supply (LSP provision, mise tool, manifest;
  `n/a` where honest). That is the **materialized escape** in
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-vocabulary.md`: a token those facts
  cover is *known* to `/vwf:doctor` without a claiming language plugin.
- **A materialized fetch is a pure read.** Once a slug is materialized, every
  `-stack-template` call returns the committed payload from the repo — so
  `plan`'s and `execute`'s conventions resolution behaves exactly as
  *Resolving the conventions* states, with no research, network, or write on
  their clock. Materialization itself happens once, interactively, when the
  pin is first made; a pin whose materialization was declined is
  **unmaterialized**, and the fetch says so rather than generating silently.
  That is not the `unresolved` axis state above and must not be recorded as one:
  the axis *was* answered, and what is missing is the artifact, not the decision.
- **The menu may carry one open entry.** A materializing adapter's menu may
  offer *generate for an uncovered technology* (pinned as
  `generated/<technology-slug>`) alongside its curated entries. That entry is
  consent-gated, reviewer-gated generation — not the retired free-text
  `custom`: nothing lands unresearched, unreviewed, or unrecorded, and the
  resulting pin resolves to a real materialized template every later check
  verifies. The open entry is not the only door into generation: a
  materializing adapter may also generate *part* of an otherwise curated pin,
  and vwf sees the same thing either way — one payload, one consent-gated
  materialization. The no-fitting-template **halt** still applies when
  nothing on any menu fits *and* no installed adapter offers generation.

## The UX gate

`execute-ux-reviewer` no longer knows how to render anything. For a UI slice it
invokes the repo's **own** `ux-gate` skill — a fixed name in the repo's
`.claude/skills/`, materialized there by whichever pack owns the project's
stack — passing the slice, the changed screens, the design-system path and the
flow's Screens contract.

**The name is fixed, and that is the point.** vwf used to construct a name,
the retired `<plugin>-ux-gate`, from the stack pin, which stops working the
moment stacks are packs rather than plugins: there is no plugin name left to
build from. A name assembled from configuration is a name that can silently
resolve to nothing, and a UX gate that resolves to nothing looks exactly like a
slice with no findings.
A fixed repo-local name either exists or does not, and its absence is
checkable. The plugin renders however its ecosystem does — a browser driver, a
snapshot test suite, a simulator — runs its accessibility equivalent, and
returns findings in vwf's vocabulary:

```yaml
rendered: ok | n/a
reason: <one line> # required when n/a
findings: [ { severity, screen, what, where } ]
```

vwf's rule is unchanged and stays vwf's: `rendered: n/a` on any UI slice is a
gap that reaches the final human gate, never a silent downgrade to a code-only
review. What counts as "rendered" is the plugin's call.

**A pack with no UI surface materializes no `ux-gate`**, and vwf finds none —
a project with no screens has nothing to render. That absence is the same
`rendered: n/a` path as a gate that declined, and carries the same rule: it
reaches the final human gate rather than downgrading silently.

## Writing a stack plugin

1. `<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the manifest: `name`, `version`,
   `description`, plus `dependencies` for any plugin whose language it builds on.
2. `skills/<name>-stack-menu/SKILL.md` and
   `skills/<name>-stack-template/SKILL.md`, both
   **`disable-model-invocation: false`**. A user-only skill cannot be invoked by
   vwf and the failure is silent.
3. A UI-owning pack materializes `skills/ux-gate/SKILL.md` into the repo's
   `.claude/` — an unprefixed, fixed name, because vwf invokes it there rather
   than through the plugin.
4. The templates themselves, in the plugin's own tree — their layout is the
   plugin's business; only the payload is contracted.

There is no registration step: the marketplace manifest is generated from the
manifests, so adding the plugin is the registration.

Nothing is added to vwf. A new stack — a language, a cloud, a framework — never
touches this plugin again, which is the whole point.
