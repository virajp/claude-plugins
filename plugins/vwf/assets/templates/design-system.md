# Design System

<!-- The product-wide UX/visual contract. A vwf foundation, peer of
     architecture.md; mandatory once the registry has a frontend/app project.
     Authored by /vwf:design-system; see the design-system-authoring skill. Record
     semantic token VALUES and scales (code-independent); never name the
     component library, CSS framework, or design file (that is plan). Every
     blueprint Screens section references this doc. -->

## Brand & Mood

One paragraph + keywords: the style direction and the feeling the product should
evoke.

## Color Tokens

| Token (role) | Light | Dark | Usage | Contrast pairing |
| ------------ | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---------------- |

## Typography

Families: heading / body / mono — named, with intent.

| Step | Size / Line height | Weight | Use |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------ | --- |

## Spacing & Layout

- Spacing scale:
- Grid / container:
- Breakpoints (width → behavioral intent):
- Radius scale:
- Elevation scale:

## Motion

- Duration tokens:
- Easing tokens:
- Principles:
- Reduced-motion behavior:

## Brand assets

<!-- The assets the PRODUCT supplies for the surfaces that represent it outside
     itself. Present when any project declares the `site` platform, or `webapp`
     with the `seo` capability; delete this section otherwise. Name each by ROLE
     and describe it — never a file path, never a size the realization picks. -->

- Favicon source mark: one square vector drawing, the whole set is rasterized
  from it — note whether it sits on a rounded tile.
- Social preview: the picture a shared link shows, 1280×640, with its alt text.
- Theme colour: a Color Token role, not a literal.

## Accessibility Standard

- Conformance target:
- Contrast / keyboard / focus / targets / semantics:

## Component Behaviors

Global patterns: buttons, inputs/forms, overlays, feedback, empty/loading/error,
navigation.

## Brand

<!-- Required when the imported design-system payload carries a `brand:` block;
     delete this section otherwise — it is never elicited in text. Written
     verbatim in meaning from the payload; every path is relative to the repo
     root. See the design-system-authoring skill's brand reference. -->

- Logo source: `<repo-relative path>`
- Variants:

| Variant | Path | Use |
| ------- | ---- | --- |

- Clear space:
- Minimum sizes (per variant):
- Rules (what never happens to the mark — mono, dark, distortion, recolor):

## Terminal UX

<!-- Required when any registry project declares platform `cli` in
     .config/vwf.yaml; delete this section otherwise. See the
     design-system-authoring skill's terminal-ux reference. -->

- Output formatting (human / machine / quiet-verbose, stdout vs stderr):
- Color semantics (roles → token names; NO_COLOR / non-TTY rule):
- Progress conventions:
- Errors & exit codes:
- Help & naming conventions:

## Anti-Patterns

- What to avoid.
