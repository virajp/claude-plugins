<!-- Template for /vwf:screens prompt — written to
     docs/prompts/screens/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>.md.
     ONE brief per flow per platform (mobile.md, tablet.md, desktop.md,
     auto.md, watch.md, tv.md, spatial.md, site.md, webapp.md — mirroring the
     flow folder's platform files), each
     commissioning exactly ONE interactive
     page. A compact wireframe-level design brief for a claude.ai/design
     canvas session, NOT a blueprint doc: no OKF frontmatter. The user pastes
     it into the canvas chat themselves — /vwf:screens never runs it. The
     brief is ALWAYS the flow's full screen blueprint — on a revision,
     regenerate the whole file in place (git keeps history); never write a
     change note. Replace every backticked `<placeholder>` with plain prose;
     drop sections marked (if any) when empty. The standing conventions — the
     naming contract (pages, frame codes, the index--<platform> stitch),
     revise-in-place, the interactive-journey mandate, the standing tweak set
     (darkMode on, device frame on with the mobile/tablet camera cutout, a
     tweak per pinned sad and conditional state), the device frame at the
     platform's RESOLVED viewport (design.viewports.<project>.<platform> in
     .config/vwf.yaml when set, else the platform's default), stub
     treatment — live in
     the canvas project's own CLAUDE.md (its repo-side source is the sibling
     CLAUDE--<platform>.md, from the adapter's conventions template) and are never
     restated here; the brief carries only the per-flow payload. The page name
     and frame codes are the sync keys — /vwf:screens import matches by them;
     never rename them. Send no design/visual instructions (no tokens, type,
     spacing, or styling) — the canvas picks the design system up from its
     Design System project, and visual treatment is decided in the canvas
     chat. What each screen SHOWS and how it BEHAVES is contract: the
     components and their rules are transcribed from the flow doc's Components
     blocks, never left for the canvas to decide. -->

# Screens brief — `<flow>` (`<platform>`)

Design the **`<flow>`** flow of **`<product name>`** for **`<platform>`** as
**one interactive page**, under this project's standing conventions (CLAUDE.md).

## Page to build (exact name — the sync key)

- **`<flow>--<platform>`** — revise in place if it exists; stitch its happy path
  into **`index--<platform>`** in flow-number order.

## Goal

This flow serves **`<goal>`**: `<one clause on why this journey matters>`.

`<for an in-car flow: one line naming the parent phone flow this journey is a
subset of — the page covers only the in-car subset, glanceable and
template-constrained>`

## The flow

`<the flow's Trigger & Actors and ordered Steps, summarized — what the user is
doing and what the system does at each step>`

**Entry points:**
`<from Trigger & Actors — one line each: who enters, from
where (app launch, deep link, notification, …), and which screen the journey
starts on; the page covers every entry point>`

## Screens (wireframe level)

One subsection per screen row in the flow's Screens contract, headed by its
pinned **code** — the frame name on the canvas; for a flow with no Screens
section yet, describe the screens the steps imply with provisional codes in step
order. Structure, navigation, components, and states — visual treatment is the
canvas's to decide.

### `<code>` — `<screen name>`

- **Purpose / step served:** `<which step(s) this screen serves>`
- **Navigates to:**
  `<the next coded screen(s) in step order — wire this
  navigation>`
- **Components:**
  `<from the row's Components block — each element the screen
  displays (text, info, error surfaces, buttons, inputs, lists, media) with its
  rules: when it is visible/enabled (e.g. the button is clickable only once the
  form validates), what activating it does, and its contract-pinned content
  (error messages, empty-state copy, CTA labels)>`
- **Sad states:**
  `<every pinned error/failure state — one tweak each on this
  frame>`
- **Conditional states (if any):**
  `<the pinned non-sad product states —
  empty data, entity-state variants — one tweak each>`
- **Form (if any):**
  `<fields and validation timing — structure and behavior
  only, no visual treatment>`

## Out of scope

`<screens/journeys adjacent flows own — composed as stubs per the project
conventions — plus parked points the design must not pre-empt (if any)>`
