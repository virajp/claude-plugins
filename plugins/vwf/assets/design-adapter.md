# Design Adapter Contract

vwf is **decoupled from any particular design tool**. It does not call
claude.ai/design, Lovable, Stitch, or anything else — it exchanges two
**normalized payloads** with the design adapter.

The split is deliberate and asymmetric:

| Direction  | How it works                                                           | Needs an adapter? |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Export** | `/vwf:screens prompt` writes design briefs to `docs/prompts/screens/…` | **No**            |
| **Import** | vwf delegates to the adapter and consumes what it returns              | **Yes**           |

**Export needs no adapter at all.** The briefs are files — the deliverable is
the markdown, and the user takes it to whatever tool they like. That half has
always been tool-agnostic; nothing about it changes.

Only **import** needs a plugin, because reading designed work back requires
speaking that tool's API.

## One adapter, many tools

vwf calls **three fixed skill names**, always:

| Skill                                                       | Returns                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/vwf:import-screens <flow> <platform>` | a **screens payload**       |
| `/vwf:import-design-system`             | a **design-system payload** |
| `/vwf:import-conversations <project>`   | a **conversations payload** |

**vwf never constructs a skill name from configuration.** It knows these three
names and nothing else. *Which* design tool answers is resolved **inside** the
adapter, from the project's configuration — because that is a fact about the
project, not about vwf's delegation.

Those three skills in turn delegate once more, to **three more fixed names in
the repo's own `.claude/skills/`** — `design-import-screens`,
`design-import-design-system` and `design-import-conversations`. Those are what
the project's `design:` pin materializes, and they are the only place a tool is
named. It is the same seam that retired the `<plugin>-ux-gate` construction,
reused rather than reinvented: a fixed name in the repo, resolved at
materialization time, never assembled at run time.

The third name is the newest and was added to close a real hole: `/vwf:feedback
canvas` used to reach one specific tool's MCP server by hardcoded prefix, so two
of the three tokens this contract advertises were **silently non-functional** for
it. A broken menu entry is worse than a naming violation, because nothing
distinguishes it from a tool that had nothing to say.

## Configuration — the tool is per project

```yaml
# .config/vwf.yaml
projects:
  website: { design: lovable }
  mobile: { design: claude-design }
```

One design tool **per registry project**, not per product: a product may design
its website in one tool and its mobile app in another, and forcing both through
one tool would be a vwf-imposed constraint on a decision vwf has no stake in.

The value is a **tool token**, and since Wave D it is also the **slug of a
menu entry on the `design` axis** — one value, not two spellings that can
disagree. Teaching vwf a new tool means adding a pack and its bundle to the
stack plugin; it never means a change in vwf, and vwf never learns the token's
meaning.

A product-wide `design.tool` is the pre-`config_format`-13 shape and is **not**
read: it is drift `/vwf:setup`'s `12 → 13` migration copies down onto each UI
project. An adapter that silently honored it would make the migration optional,
and the config would keep two answers to one question.

### Every adapter skill MUST be model-invocable

That is `disable-model-invocation: false` in the skill's frontmatter. This is the
single most important rule in this contract, and getting it wrong fails
**silently**: `disable-model-invocation: true` removes the skill from the model's
context entirely and blocks programmatic invocation — so a delegated call to such
a skill does not error. vwf simply cannot see it, and the import quietly does
nothing.

An adapter whose skills are user-only is indistinguishable, at runtime, from an
adapter that returned an empty payload. It applies to **both** hops: vwf's three
import skills, and the three materialized ones they delegate to. The stack
plugin's own reviewer gate enforces the materialized half — all three present
and all three model-invocable — because a missing one is silently unavailable
rather than a smaller feature.

### The preflight, because the failure mode is silence

Before delegating, `/vwf:design-system`, `/vwf:screens import` and
`/vwf:feedback canvas` **check the project's configured tool** rather than
calling and inferring from the result — that inference is impossible.

Three distinct halts, because they need three different fixes:

| Condition                              | Message                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No design tool configured for the project | "No design tool for `<project>`. Set `projects.<project>.design` in `.config/vwf.yaml`." |
| Configured tool has not been materialized | "`<project>` sets `design: <token>`, but the repo has no `design-import-*` skill. Materialize that pin." |
| Adapter returned nothing / garbage        | "The design adapter returned no usable payload." (with the parse error)              |

Never collapse these into one message. "Design import failed" sends the user
looking in the wrong place two times out of three. The adapter halts on the
first two itself, with the same distinction — an unsupported tool must **halt**,
never quietly return an empty result.

## Payload 1 — screens

Returned by `/vwf:import-screens <flow> <platform>`. Shapes
match the flow platform template, so `/vwf:screens import` can diff it
directly against the Screens contract.

```yaml
flow: <NNN>-<flow-slug>
project: <registry-project>
platform: mobile | tablet | desktop | auto | site | webapp
screens:
  - code: <NNN><letter> # the pinned screen code — the join key
    name: <screen name>
    purpose: <one line>
    components: # what the screen is built from
      - name: <component>
        role: <what it does here>
        states: [ default, empty, loading, error, … ]
    states: # screen-level states the design actually shows
      - name: <state>
        description: <what the user sees>
    notes: [] # anything the tool recorded that has no contract slot
source: # provenance, so a diff can cite where a delta came from
  tool: <tool token>
  reference: <url or id the adapter can resolve back to>
```

**`code` is the join key.** A tool whose designs cannot recover the pinned
screen codes cannot produce a diffable payload — the adapter should return the
screens it has with `code: null` and say so in `notes`, rather than inventing
codes.

## Payload 2 — design system

Returned by `/vwf:import-design-system`. Shapes match the
design-system template's sections, so `/vwf:design-system` can write the doc
from it.

```yaml
name: <design system name>
tokens:
  color: # SEMANTIC roles, never raw swatches
    - {
        role: <primary|surface|danger|…>,
        value: <token or hex>,
        usage: <one line>,
      }
  typography:
    - {
        role: <display|heading|body|caption>,
        size: <>,
        weight: <>,
        line_height: <>,
      }
  spacing: { scale: [ … ], base: <> }
  radius: { … }
  motion:
    - { role: <enter|exit|emphasis>, duration: <>, easing: <> }
components:
  - name: <component>
    variants: [ … ]
    behaviors: [ <one line each> ]
    anti_patterns: [ <one line each> ]
accessibility:
  standard: <WCAG 2.2 AA | …>
  rules: [ <contrast, focus order, target size, …> ]
source:
  tool: <tool token>
  reference: <url or id>
  derived: true | false # true when the adapter INFERRED tokens from generated
# code rather than reading a stored design system. vwf records this in the
# doc, because a derived system can drift silently on the next generation.
```

**`derived: true` is not a defect** — some tools genuinely have no stored design
system and reconstruct it from what they generated. It must be recorded, because
the freshness guarantee differs: a stored system is authoritative until changed,
a derived one is a snapshot of one moment.

### The optional `brand:` block

A tool that also holds the product's **logo** returns it as one more top-level
block, after the fields above. The block is **optional**: a tool with no brand
concept **omits it entirely** — never a `brand:` full of nulls, which
`/vwf:design-system` would read as a logo nobody could resolve. When present,
vwf writes the doc's **Brand** section from it and elicits nothing for it; when
absent, the section is deleted and brand is never asked for in text.

```yaml
brand:
  logo: <repo-relative path to the source file; SVG expected>
  variants: # every form the tool holds — mark, wordmark, lockup, mono, dark, …
    - { name: <variant>, path: <repo-relative path>, use: <one line — where it goes> }
  clear_space: <rule in the logo's own units, e.g. "the mark's cap height on every side">
  min_size: # per variant, where the tool states one
    - { variant: <name>, value: <e.g. 24px on screen, 8mm in print> }
  rules: [ <one line each — what never happens to the mark> ]
```

**Every path is relative to the repo root**, never absolute and never a URL —
the doc is an offline contract, and a path only the tool's host can resolve is
a broken reference the moment the repo is cloned. `logo` names the one source
every variant derives from; a tool that holds variants but no single source
returns `logo: null` with a `rules` line saying so, rather than promoting one
variant to source.

## Payload 3 — conversations

Returned by `/vwf:import-conversations <project>`, one call
per registry project. Feeds `/vwf:feedback canvas`, which classifies and routes
each remark through its normal pipeline.

```yaml
harvested: ok
project: <registry-project>
remarks:
  - surface: screen | state | design-system | project # what the remark bears on
    code: <NNN><letter> # the pinned screen code, or null when not recoverable
    platform: mobile | tablet | desktop | auto | site | webapp # or null
    kind: comment | change-request | observation
    remark: <what was said, close to how it was said>
    notes: [] # ambiguity, truncation, anything with no slot above
source:
  tool: <tool token>
  reference: <canvas project id / url the remark came from>
```

**`code` is the join key here too**, and the same rule applies: `null` plus a
`notes` line beats a guess, which would attach a remark to the wrong contract
row.

**A tool with no review surface returns `n/a`, and that is not a failure:**

```yaml
harvested: n/a
reason: <one line — why this tool has no conversation to read>
source: { tool: <tool token> }
```

This is the one payload that may legitimately come back empty-handed, and the
distinction is load-bearing in **both** directions:

- `n/a` means *this tool has no such surface* — vwf reports it plainly and stops.
  It is not a gap, not a finding, and nothing to fix. Only one of the three
  supported tokens has a review conversation at all, so this is the common
  answer rather than the rare one.
- `ERROR:` means *the surface exists and could not be read* — unreachable,
  unauthorized, unparseable. That one is worth acting on.

Collapsing them would send a Lovable or Stitch user to `/mcp` to repair a
connection that was never the problem. This is also why `import-screens` and
`import-design-system` have **no** `n/a` form and must halt instead: there, an
empty result is indistinguishable from a design nobody authored.

## What stays vwf's job

The adapter returns data. **Everything downstream is vwf's**, and no adapter
gets to do it:

- Diffing a screens payload against the Screens contract.
- Routing every accepted delta through `/vwf:blueprint` — an adapter never edits
  a flow doc.
- Writing `design-system.md` from a design-system payload, gated by the
  `design-system-reviewer`.
- The naming contract in the briefs (pages `<flow>--<platform>`, frames by
  screen code, `index--<platform>`). Since export is prompt-only, this is now
  **instruction text inside the brief** addressed to whatever tool receives it —
  not something vwf enforces through an API.

## Adding a tool

A new design tool is a **pack and a bundle in the stack plugin**, not a new
plugin and not a new vwf code path. vwf changes not at all.

1. Add a `design-tool` pack with **all three** skills at the fixed names
   `design-import-screens`, `design-import-design-system` and
   `design-import-conversations`, each stating how to read that tool and fill
   its payload. A tool with no review surface **still gets the third**; it
   returns `harvested: n/a` with the reason, which is what keeps *unsupported*
   distinguishable from *unimplemented*. The design-system payload's `brand:`
   block is the one optional part: a tool that holds no logo leaves it out.
2. Add a bundle on the `design` axis whose **slug is the tool token** the
   project config will hold, so the menu pick and the config key are one value.
3. All three must be **model-invocable**. A user-only one is invisible to vwf
   and returns nothing rather than erroring.
4. Each returns **only** the payload (YAML or JSON), nothing before or after —
   the same discipline as vwf's subagent return contracts.
5. Unrecoverable fields are `null` with a line in `notes`. Never invent a screen
   code, a token value, or a component the tool did not actually report.
6. Auth is the pack's business — tools differ (OAuth, an API key, an MCP
   connection), and vwf deliberately knows nothing about it. Where the tool is
   reached over MCP, the pack declares the server and the materializer writes it
   into the project's `.mcp.json` behind its own consent line.
