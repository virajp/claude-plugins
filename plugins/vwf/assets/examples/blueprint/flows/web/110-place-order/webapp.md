<!-- Both screens sit behind a session, so neither is offered to search or
     listed in the sitemap — `index: no` is the decision, not an omission. They
     still carry a title and description: a shared link and a browser tab
     announce the page whether or not a crawler may read it. Product-wide
     values — the site name among them — are
     ../../../conventions.md#web-metadata, never restated in a title here. -->
