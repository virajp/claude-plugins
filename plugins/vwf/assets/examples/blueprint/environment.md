# Environment & Secrets

> The authoritative inventory of every environment variable and secret the
> system needs — names, purpose, issuer, and consumers. **No values**: values
> live only in the secrets manager (development), the forge's secrets (CI) or
> the cloud provider's secret store (staging, production), injected at runtime.
> The injection mechanism (the decision) is [config](./conventions.md#config).

<!-- Conformance example (blueprint-format 24). A worked, format-valid catalog:
     mandatory frontmatter, rows grouped by consuming project, every row
     classified, the config mechanism linked (not restated), and no values.
     Project names resolve against ./registry.yaml, which this bundle carries;
     architecture.md (its prose view) is omitted for brevity. `ci` is not a
     registry project — it is the pipeline, listed here because it consumes
     secrets. -->

## What belongs here

A row belongs here if it configures a project at runtime or build. Each row is
classified `secret` (leaking it grants access or incurs cost), `non-secret`
(operational config, no access value), or `client-id` (public, restricted).

## Conventions

- **Variable** — the exact env var name injected.
- **Purpose** — what it configures or unlocks.
- **Source / issuer** — where an operator obtains or rotates the value.
- **Used by** — the registry project(s) that read it.
- **Required** — whether the project fails to start without it.
- **Secret** — `secret` · `non-secret` · `client-id`.

## API (`service`)

| Variable               | Purpose                                          | Source / issuer     | Used by   | Required            | Secret     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| `PAYMENTS_API_KEY`     | Server secret for the payment provider (charges) | Payments dashboard  | api       | yes                 | secret     |
| `PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` | Verifies inbound payment webhook signatures      | Payments dashboard  | api       | prod (test default) | secret     |
| `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY`  | Signs/verifies bearer session tokens             | Generated, org-held | api       | yes                 | secret     |
| `LOG_LEVEL`            | Log verbosity (`debug`…`error`)                  | Deployment env      | api · web | no (default `info`) | non-secret |

## Web (`site`)

| Variable              | Purpose                                              | Source / issuer | Used by | Required | Secret     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL the browser calls the API at (SSR + client) | Deployment env  | web     | yes      | non-secret |

## Shared / cross-project

`LOG_LEVEL` is read by both `api` and `web`; it is catalogued once under API
above with both consumers listed in *Used by*.

## CI / CD

| Variable        | Purpose                              | Source / issuer | Type       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| `DEPLOY_TOKEN`  | Authenticates the deploy to the host | Host IAM        | `secret`   |
| `DEPLOY_REGION` | Target region for the deploy         | manual          | `variable` |

## Local development & test

Local runs use a **test** payment key and a fixed non-production
`SESSION_SIGNING_KEY`, with `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` pointed at `localhost`. These
are non-production and grant no access to real infrastructure; no production
secret is ever used or committed for local dev.

## Rotation

Secrets are rotated at the issuer and updated where each environment keeps
them — the secrets manager, the forge's secrets, the cloud provider's secret
store; no code change is needed (values are env-injected).
`PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` must be rotated in lock-step with the provider's webhook
endpoint config.

## Adding a variable

1. Obtain/create the value at the issuer.
2. Store it in the secrets manager for development, the forge's secrets for CI,
   and the cloud provider's secret store for staging and production.
3. Wire it into the consuming project's config loading (realization — see
   `plan`).
4. Add a row here — name, purpose, issuer, used-by, required, secret — **no
   value**.
5. If it introduces a new integration, reconcile the architecture registry.
