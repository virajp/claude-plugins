# MemPalace save checkpoint — every Nth agent stop, tell the model to persist.
#
# Written for this toolkit rather than vendored. Upstream's hook parses
# `transcript_path`, a Claude Code JSONL transcript, to count human messages.
# Counting *stops* in a state file instead needs nothing from the payload but a
# session id, which is simpler and is what the tests cover
# (installer/src/mempalace-checkpoint-script.test.ts).
#
# Contract:
#   stdin  — JSON with `session_id`, and on a stop `stop_hook_active`
#   stdout — nothing to say nothing; otherwise a `gate` verdict carrying the
#            instruction, which each target renders as a block plus reason
#
# Invoked two ways, by `hooks.json`:
#   (no argument)  the stop hook — counts, and speaks every SAVE_INTERVAL
#   --compact      the pre-compact hook — always speaks, and resets the count
#
# POSIX sh with BSD-portable tooling only: this runs on macOS, where `sed` has
# no `\s`/`\b` and `grep -P` does not exist.

# and `permissionDecisionReason`. Those belong to `PreToolUse`, which this hook
# is not, and Claude rejected the whole verdict for the missing `hookEventName`
# — so the checkpoint never fired. There is no `hookSpecificOutput` variant for
# `Stop` that carries a denial (its one field is `additionalContext`, which
# lets the stop through) and none at all for `PreCompact`, so the fix is to
# drop the block rather than name the event in it.
