# verify — Check a Deployed Environment Against the Blueprint

Run **after a deploy** (yours or CI's) to answer: does the deployed product
still do what the blueprint promises? vwf never deploys — deployment is yours;
this command only observes and verifies.

Two passes: **health** (is every deployed project up) and **acceptance** (do the
blueprint's flow criteria hold against the real environment). A failure here is
production feedback — it routes exactly like `/vwf:feedback` input. A clean run
against **production** additionally offers to record a **release** (§5) —
freezing each deployed service's API contract and every stored entity's schema,
the point from which backward compatibility is enforced.

## Halt Conditions

- No flow docs with Acceptance blocks under `docs/blueprint/flows/` **and** no
  deployable project in the registry → nothing to verify; say so and stop.
- `$ARGUMENTS` names no environment and more than one is plausible → ask which
  (staging, production, …) and wait.

## Format Check

Run the preflight in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/format-check.md`; nudge
`/vwf:setup` on drift (proceed unless the needed Acceptance blocks are missing —
a pre-format-4 repo has nothing to verify flows against; tell the user to run
`/vwf:setup` then stop).

## Pipeline

### 1. Resolve the target

Read the registry (`docs/blueprint/registry.yaml`) for the deployed projects
(any project declaring `service`, `worker`, `site` or `webapp` — the deployed
surfaces; device screen platforms ship through a store and `iac`, `data` and
`system` platforms are not deployed environments vwf checks) and the Acceptance
blocks of every flow under
`docs/blueprint/flows/*/*/index.md`. Resolve each project's base URL for the
named environment from the **`environments:` block in `.config/vwf.yaml`** first
(per the vwf-config asset); fall back to the repo's own configuration (deploy
manifests, env files by **name** via `docs/blueprint/environment.md`, mise
tasks) — ask the user for anything unresolvable, never guess a hostname, and
**offer to pin what was resolved/asked into the config** so the next run asks
nothing. Health probes honor any per-project override
(`projects.<name>.harness.health` — a declared `n/a` is reported as such, not
"unverifiable").

**Environment names are canonical** per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/delivery-pipeline.md`: `development` / `staging` /
`production`. Resolve a synonym the user types (`dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod`)
to its canonical environment, and flag a synonym **key** in the config's
`environments:` block as drift (offer the rename; never normalize silently).

**The release environment** is the one named `production`, unless the config's
`production_env:` key names another (per the vwf-config asset). Note whether
this run targets it — §5 fires only then. A staging run is never a release
(`pipeline/staging-is-not-a-release`).

**Deferred core token (production runs only).** When this run targets the
release environment, read the registry for any `<foundation>: deferred-preprod`
core token (per the product-foundations skill) and report it as a **blocking**
finding — the product is shipping to customers on a foundation it explicitly
said was not ready; §5 (release) does not fire while one is present.

**Recall.** Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/memory.md`, recall rooms `gaps`
and `problems` for still-open items — a criterion already known-failing is
reported as **known**, not rediscovered. Skip silently if mempalace is down.

### 2. Health pass

For each deployed project: probe its health/readiness endpoint (or root) and
record up/down + version where exposed. The probes are independent — **issue
them all in a single message** so they run concurrently rather than serially
down the registry. A `worker` with no HTTP surface is checked by its own
observable (its queue/schedule heartbeat if the repo exposes one) or reported
`unverifiable — no health surface` (a candidate gap, not a silent skip).

**Version cross-check (report-only).** Where a `service` project exposes a
version and has a living contract `docs/blueprint/apis/<project>.openapi.yaml`,
compare the deployed version to the contract's `info.version` — a mismatch is
reported as a warning (deploys lag contracts), never a halt.

**Reliability targets (report-only).** When `conventions.md#reliability` exists
(the reliability-targets foundation), judge the health pass against it: a probe
that succeeds but breaches the service's stated latency SLO is reported as a
**warning**, never a pass — and never a halt.

### 3. Acceptance pass (against the environment)

Dispatch `execute-acceptance-verifier` in **environment mode**: pass the
Acceptance blocks of **every** flow (`docs/blueprint/flows/*/*/index.md` —
regressions in untouched flows are the point, not just the last plan's), the
registry, the target environment's base URLs, and the repo's staging-mode E2E
mechanism per the harness contract (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/harness.md` —
the canonical `test:e2e:staging` task, else the stamped equivalent; the
`.config/vwf.yaml` `harness:` block says whether `e2e_staging` exists at all) —
it runs the suite against the deployed environment, never against local
emulators, and returns the standard per-criterion `PASS` / `FAIL` /
`NOT-COVERED` block. `n/a — no staging
harness` → report what is missing (the
harness is a gap).

### 4. Report & route

Present: per-project health, then per-criterion results. Route every failure per
the **feedback routing** (`/vwf:feedback`'s rules — this command's failures are
just automated feedback):

- **Criterion FAIL** (behavior regression) → file to room `gaps`; offer the fix
  path now — `/vwf:blueprint <flow|entity>` if the blueprint is wrong,
  `/vwf:plan <slice>` for a fix cycle. Deferred → record one line in the owning
  flow doc's **Open Questions** so it survives a mempalace outage.
- **Health down / infrastructure failure** → report precisely (project, probe,
  error); this is operational, not a blueprint gap — do not file it as one. On
  a **production** run, additionally name the matching runbook from the
  `conventions.md#incidents` alert-condition table (the incident-response
  foundation) when one exists, and offer `/vwf:feedback incident` to file the
  incident and its postmortem stub.
- **NOT-COVERED / no harness** → a testing gap; file to room `gaps` and offer a
  plan step next cycle.

**Production failures: name the rollback first.** When this run targeted the
release environment and a probe or criterion failed, the **first offered
remedy** is "roll back to `<previous tag>`" — the previous release the release
record names (the latest prior `apis/released/` snapshot, per
`pipeline/rollback-path` in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/delivery-pipeline.md`) — then fix-forward via the
routes above. This command **names** the rollback; it never executes a deploy —
deployment is yours. A release record naming no rollback target (an
irreversible release) leaves only the fix-forward routes; say so.

### 5. Release (production only)

Runs only when this run targeted the **release environment** (§1) **and** both
passes came back clean (every probed project healthy, every criterion `PASS`).
Only then, read [Release freeze](references/release-freeze.md) and follow it —
the confirmation prompt, the per-`service` snapshot into `apis/released/`, the
per-entity `schema.yaml` snapshot into its sibling `entities/` dir (same copy
machinery, same freeze moment), and the never-overwrite rule. A staging run, or
any run with a failure, skips this section entirely.

**Persist.** Store the run's outcome (environment, per-criterion results,
routing, any release recorded) to mempalace room `problems` (releases also to
room `decisions`), and each gap to room `gaps`. Skip silently if mempalace is
down — the routed doc edits are the durable record.

If any doc was edited (deferred routings, release snapshots), commit via
`/vwf:git-workflow`. Verify is otherwise read-only.
