# MemPalace

A searchable memory palace for AI — mine projects and conversations, then search them semantically.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `mempalace` is installed:

```bash
mempalace --version
```

If not, install it as a mise-managed tool — add to the `[tools]` section of the
mise config (installs the CLI and `mempalace-mcp`):

```toml
"pipx:mempalace" = { version = "latest" }
```

Global or project-level is your choice; in a multi-environment mise split it
belongs in the **development** config, since the tool is only needed in the dev
environment.

### Backend: Qdrant, in a container

Use **qdrant** as the backend rather than the chroma default — chroma does not
support concurrent access, qdrant does. Run it as a container with its port
published to loopback, so the `mempalace` running on the local machine can
reach it:

```bash
docker run -d --name qdrant -p 127.0.0.1:6333:6333 docker.io/qdrant/qdrant:latest
```

Persist `/qdrant/storage` with a bind mount so the vectors outlive the
container.

### Configuration

`mempalace` picks its configuration up from `~/.mempalace/config.json` and
`MEMPALACE_*` environment variables, and the precedence **differs by setting**
— know it exactly when debugging:

- **Choosing the backend:** `--backend` flag → config.json `"backend"` →
  `MEMPALACE_BACKEND` → default `chroma`. The **file beats env** here, and the
  unconfigured default is chroma.
- **Qdrant connection settings** (`qdrant_url`, `qdrant_api_key`,
  `qdrant_namespace`, `qdrant_timeout`): `MEMPALACE_QDRANT_*` env vars →
  config.json → defaults (`http://localhost:6333`, 10 s timeout). **Env beats
  the file** here — so a stale variable in Claude's environment can point the
  server at the wrong qdrant even when config.json is right.

The MCP server is a child of each Claude session, so the environment it sees is
Claude's — which includes the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`.
Keep the file and the env vars stating the same values, as below, so the flip
never bites. The palace lives at `~/.local/share/mempalace`. A sample
`~/.mempalace/config.json` (`palace_path` is one canonical absolute spelling —
the path string is the palace's identity):

```json
{
  "palace_path": "/Users/you/.local/share/mempalace",
  "collection_name": "mempalace_drawers",
  "backend": "qdrant",
  "qdrant_url": "http://127.0.0.1:6333"
}
```

The environment variables go in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "MEMPALACE_BACKEND": "qdrant",
    "MEMPALACE_MAX_BACKUPS": "4",
    "MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH": "~/.local/share/mempalace",
    "MEMPALACE_QDRANT_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:6333"
  }
}
```

Claude passes these values literally — `$HOME` and `${HOME}` stay exactly as
typed — so write the palace path with `~` (mempalace expands it) or as an
absolute path.

Set `MEMPALACE_BACKEND` and `MEMPALACE_QDRANT_URL` **together** — the URL
without the backend key silently selects chroma.

Two more variables are optional: `MEMPALACE_EMBEDDING_MODEL` and
`MEMPALACE_EMBEDDING_DEVICE`. A palace is bound to the model it was built
with — opening it under another model fails with
`EmbedderIdentityMismatchError` — and mempalace 3.10.0's `repair` cannot
re-embed a qdrant palace, so switching models means dumping the drawers and
refiling them into a fresh palace.

### The MCP server

vwf's plugin manifest spawns the server over stdio, through
`mise x -- mempalace-mcp`, once per Claude session. There is no daemon to run,
supervise or restart: the server reads its palace path and backend from the
environment above and `~/.mempalace/config.json`. The cost is that each session
runs its own server, and its own embedder with it.

## Usage

MemPalace provides dynamic, version-correct instructions via the CLI. To get instructions for any operation:

```bash
mempalace instructions <command>
```

Where `<command>` is one of: `help`, `init`, `mine`, `search`, `status`.

Run the appropriate instructions command, then follow the returned instructions step by step.

## Recalling past work

This skill covers setup, mining, and status. For questions about past
work, prior decisions, or people that may already be filed in the
palace, prefer the **`mempalace-recall`** skill — it enforces
search-before-answer so the agent reads the palace instead of guessing.

## Cursor-specific notes

- The `mempalace-mcp` server is declared by the vwf plugin manifest. The
  MemPalace MCP tools (`mempalace_search`, `mempalace_add_drawer`,
  `mempalace_diary_write`, `mempalace_check_duplicate`, `mempalace_diary_read`,
  etc.) are available to the agent once the plugin is installed, `mempalace` is
  installed through mise, and the `env` block above is set.
- For automatic background saving every N agent turns plus session-start memory recall, also install the Cursor hooks separately by running `hooks/cursor/install.sh --scope user` from a cloned MemPalace repo.
- The recommended `agent_name` when calling `mempalace_diary_write` from a Cursor session is `cursor-ide` (matches the precedent of `claude-code` and `codex`).
