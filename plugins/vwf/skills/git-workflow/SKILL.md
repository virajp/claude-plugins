# Git Workflow

## Core Rules

- Use a worktree for all substantive changes — never work directly in the main
  worktree
- Worktrees are always created for the **outermost superproject**, never a
  submodule (Step 1 resolves this)
- **A sibling member is its own outermost superproject.** Under a `multi-repo`
  product with `linkage: siblings`, the members are ordinary repos — the
  superproject walk correctly ends at the member, and that is where the worktree
  belongs. The base repo is a **separate** checkout the caller writes to
  directly; it is never reached by walking up from a member
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/membership.md`)
- **Initialize** every new worktree with its mise bootstrap task (Step 2d), and
  **end** every worktree with full coverage — land the branch (plus any
  submodule work and pointer updates), then remove it (Step 4)
- **How a branch lands is the repo's choice, not this skill's.** The repo's
  `MERGE_MODEL` decides: `direct` (the default) merges the branch to the
  destination and pushes, as it always has; `pr` pushes the branch and opens a
  pull request instead, merging nothing locally. The two task names are the same
  in both modes — `mise x -- mise run code:merge:develop <branch>` and
  `mise x -- mise run code:merge:main`. Step 4 reads the mode before it offers
  its options
- **The merge tasks refuse a dirty tree** — untracked files, uncommitted
  changes, or unpushed commits on the branch each stop the merge before it
  touches git. That is not a nuisance: whatever is uncommitted at merge time is
  work the merge commit would claim to carry and does not, and the repair
  belongs on the branch that caused it. Commit or clean first, then re-run
- Never push without explicit user request — always ask after a successful
  commit
- Check `no-commit-to-branch` hook in `.config/pre-commit-config.yaml` before
  committing to any branch

## Caller Preferences

This command takes **no arguments** — callers parameterize its behavior through
**declared preferences in the invocation text** (e.g. `/vwf:execute`: "isolate
without asking; commit only — never merge/push"). Honor any such declared
preference: it drives the **Step 1** consent (skip the worktree prompt when
isolation is pre-declared) and the **Step 4** post-commit choice (take the
declared action, skip the prompt). Absent a declared preference, ask as each
step specifies.

## Safety Rules

**Never:**

- `--force`, `--no-verify`, `reset --hard`, force-push to `main`/`develop`
- Update git config
- Any destructive operation without explicit user request

If hooks fail during a commit: fix the issue, then create a **new commit** —
never `--amend` after a hook failure, never retry with `--no-verify`.

## References

The two branches most runs never take. Read one only when the step below routes
you into it — a run that lands in an existing worktree and stops at a commit
needs neither.

| Reference                                     | When to read                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Worktree setup](references/worktree-setup.md) | **Step 2** — only when Step 1 concluded a worktree must be created (native tool, git fallback, submodules, mise init) |
| [Landing a branch](references/landing.md)      | **Step 4** — only when the chosen post-commit action is one of the two landing options (submodule order, push, the `pr` path, teardown, stale sweep) |

## Step 1 — Detect Existing Isolation

**Before creating anything, check if you are already in an isolated workspace.**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

**Submodule guard:** `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also true inside git submodules.
Before concluding anything, resolve whether you are inside a submodule:

```bash
SUPERPROJECT=$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null)
```

**If `SUPERPROJECT` is non-empty, you are inside a submodule.** The worktree
must be created for the **parent repo**, never for the submodule. Move to the
superproject root and re-run the detection from there — every step below
(consent, worktree creation, submodule init) then operates on the parent repo:

```bash
cd "$SUPERPROJECT"
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

If the parent repo is itself nested in a further superproject, repeat until
`git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree` is empty — the worktree is
always created at the outermost parent.

**If `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` (and not a submodule):** You are already in a
linked worktree — skip directly to Step 3. Do NOT create another worktree.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** You are in the main checkout. Ask for consent:

> "Would you like me to set up an isolated worktree? It protects your current
> branch from changes."

Honor any existing declared preference without asking again. If declined, work
in place and skip to Step 3.

---

## Step 2 — Create Isolated Workspace

Read [Worktree setup](references/worktree-setup.md) and follow it: the four
mechanisms in order (native tool, git fallback, submodule init, mise init),
stopping at the first that applies. Every new worktree ends at **2c** and **2d**
— submodules populated and the init task run — whichever mechanism created it.

---

## Step 3 — Commit Workflow

Work from the **repository root**.

1. `code:precommit` — run the hooks **before you stage**. The task reads the
   working tree's changed files, staged and unstaged, so nothing has to be
   staged for it to see your work — and running it first is what folds a
   formatter's reflow and a linter's fix into the very commit you are about to
   write, instead of into a second "fix hooks" commit that means nothing to
   anyone reading the history. Guard it with the same `have_task` check Step 2d
   uses; **skip silently** when the task is absent.

   **Run it twice.** The task fails when a hook fails, and a hook that *fixed*
   a file fails by design — that is how pre-commit reports "I changed something,
   look again". So the first pass is allowed to fail and the second is not: if
   the repeat still fails, a hook found something it cannot fix and that is a
   real stop, not a fixup.

   ```bash
   have_task code:precommit || exit 0
   mise x -- mise run code:precommit || true   # pass 1: may fix, may fail
   mise x -- mise run code:precommit           # pass 2: must be clean
   ```

   The `|| true` belongs **here, on the first pass only** — never inside the
   task. A task that swallows its own failures can never gate anything; a caller
   that ignores one failure it expects, once, still can.
2. `git status` → `git add <files>` (never `git add -A`) — staging comes
   **after** step 1, so what you stage is already what the hooks want
3. `git diff --cached` — review staged changes
4. Read `.config/git-conventional-commits.yaml` for authoritative types and
   scopes — do not invent scopes
5. `mise x -- git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"`
6. If hooks fail: fix, then **new commit** (never `--amend`, never
   `--no-verify`)

### Commit Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- Lowercase, imperative mood, under 72 characters, no trailing period
- Scope is optional — omit when the change spans multiple areas

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `wip`, `blueprint`, `test`, `ops`,
`docs`, `merge`

---

## Step 4 — Post-Commit Action

**Caller-declared preference.** If the invoker declared a post-commit action
(e.g. `/vwf:execute`: "commit only — do not prompt, never merge or push"), honor
it without asking: take that action and skip the prompt below. This is the only
way the prompt is bypassed.

**Read the landing mode before you ask.** What the merge tasks do is the repo's
setting, so resolve it first — an absent or empty value means `direct`:

```bash
MERGE_MODEL=$(mise env -s bash 2>/dev/null \
  | sed -n 's/^export MERGE_MODEL=//p' | tr -d '"')
MERGE_MODEL=${MERGE_MODEL:-direct}
```

Otherwise, after a successful commit, ask the user to choose what to do next via
`AskUserQuestion` with these three options — the first is the same in both
modes, the other two are worded by the mode you just read:

**Under `direct`:**

- **Commit only** — stop here; leave the worktree as-is for continued work.
- **Merge, push & clean up** — merge to the default branch in the main worktree,
  push changes, then archive/delete the additional worktree.
- **Merge, push & keep worktree** — merge to the default branch in the main
  worktree, push changes, but leave the additional worktree open for continued
  work.

**Under `pr`:**

- **Commit only** — stop here; leave the worktree as-is for continued work.
- **Push & open PR & clean up** — push the branch and open a pull request, then
  archive/delete the additional worktree.
- **Push & open PR & keep worktree** — push the branch and open a pull request,
  leaving the additional worktree open for continued work.

Under `pr` the task pushes the branch, opens the pull request and **stops** —
nothing is merged, and the change lands only when someone merges that pull
request. So say plainly which you are doing: **clean up** removes the worktree
while the pull request is still open, and **keep worktree** leaves it in place
for review fixes, which is the safer default to suggest when the user has no
preference.

**On a merge conflict (either land sequence).** This applies under `direct`
only, where a merge actually happens locally. If a merge — the outer repo's or a
submodule merge task — **conflicts**, do **not** resolve it autonomously. Abort
the merge cleanly (`git merge --abort`, or the task's equivalent), leave the
worktree **intact**, and report the conflicting files to the caller. Callers
treat this as a **hard halt**. Under `pr` nothing merges locally, so the outer
repo cannot conflict here; a submodule that lands under its own `direct` mode
still can, and the same hard halt applies to it.

Execute the chosen action:

### Commit only

Nothing further. Inform the user the commit is done and the worktree remains
available.

### The two landing options

Read [Landing a branch](references/landing.md) and follow the sequence for the
chosen option — submodules first, then the outer repo's pointers and its merge
task; under `direct` that task merges and pushes, under `pr` it pushes and opens
the pull request. **Clean up** additionally removes this worktree and sweeps
stale ones, **keep worktree** leaves it in place.
