# Stack Checks (§§3–5)

Read this before running §3. It covers the three per-project stack checks:
languages (LSP + toolchain), frameworks and dependencies against each manifest,
and the repo/axis tooling. **Blocking** findings live in §3 (a language no
installed plugin claims) and §5 (a `custom` template pin, a missing `mise`, an
`iac` project inside another repo the user has not declined to extract).

## An unresolved axis is a degradation, and it makes two others conditional

Since `config_format` 16 any stack axis may read `unresolved` — deferred, not
decided (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/vwf-config.md`, "The three axis states").
It is a **degradation**, reported every run, never blocking: it records a
decision postponed, not a repo in a bad state. Every check below that depends on
that axis reports **`not checked — no stack resolved`** and moves on — not a
pass, not a finding. Name the project and the axis, and give
`/vwf:architecture` as the remedy; never an install, since the question is
unanswered rather than unanswerable.

`unresolved` is the bare scalar on the list axes too, so `deploy_template:
unresolved` is deferral while `deploy_template: []` is a completed decision.
Treat them as opposites: `[]` is checked as an answer, `unresolved` is not
checked at all.

**Two findings this file otherwise raises as blocking are conditional on it**,
because a product nobody has chosen a stack for yet would otherwise halt `setup`
and `execute` on day one:

| Finding                | Blocking when                                                | Degradation when                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **unknown language** (§3) | that project's `template` is **pinned**                     | that project's `template` reads `unresolved`         |
| **missing `mise`** (§5)   | any axis in the repo is pinned, or any harness capability is claimed | no axis is pinned anywhere and no capability is claimed |

The severity follows the pin, never the calendar — the moment an axis is
answered, the finding reverts to blocking on the next run.

## 3. Languages — LSP and toolchain

For each project, for each token in `stack.languages`, resolve its row in the
stack vocabulary. A project whose `template` reads `unresolved` records
`languages: []` — the one legal empty — so there is nothing to resolve and the
whole section reports `not checked — no stack resolved` for it:

- **LSP** — the row names a plugin. Check it is active
  (`claude plugin list --scope project`, falling back to user scope). Missing →
  finding, with `/plugin` as the remedy. Row says `none` → report *no LSP
  available in this marketplace* and move on. **No installed plugin declares
  the token, but the project's pin resolves to a materialized template whose
  payload carries `language_facts` for it** (the materialized escape,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-vocabulary.md`) → the language is
  **known**: verify against those facts instead — the LSP per how the facts say
  it is provided, the mise tool and manifest per the fact values, `n/a`
  accepted silently as an answer. **A token declared only under a template's
  `optional_languages:` counts as declared** — the template admits it, which is
  what this test asks. Say so in the report, though: an optional token carries
  no language facts of its own, so its LSP/toolchain/manifest rows read
  **unverified** rather than passing. Known-but-unverified is an honest third
  answer, and quietly reporting it as a pass would be the drift this check
  exists to catch. **No installed plugin declares the
  token and no materialized facts cover it** → report **unknown language**.
  **Blocking once this project's `template` is pinned**: nothing else can be
  checked for the token, and a stack vwf has no template for is one it cannot
  plan or build against. **A degradation while that `template` reads
  `unresolved`** — a project in that state should carry no tokens at all, and
  one that does cannot be blocked on a plugin that has not been chosen yet
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-vocabulary.md`). Either way the remedy is
  two lines — install the stack plugin that declares the language, or write one
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-adapter.md`) — never a suggestion to
  drop the token, which would only hide the project.
- **Toolchain** — the row names a mise tool. Check it appears in the repo's mise
  config (`.config/mise*.toml`, per the mise skill's five-file split) or
  resolves on `PATH`. Missing → finding, with the `mise use` line as the remedy.
  A `—` in the column means the toolchain is not mise-managed; skip silently.

Report per language, not per project — one missing Dart LSP is one finding even
when three projects declare `dart`.

## 4. Frameworks and dependencies — manifests

For each project, read the manifest its languages imply (the vocabulary's
Manifest column, resolved against the project's `path` from the registry). Check
each `stack.frameworks` and `stack.dependencies` token appears there.

Match on the **token as a substring of a dependency name**, case-insensitively —
`effect` matches `effect` and `@effect/platform`; `tailwindcss` matches
`tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`. This is deliberately loose: the goal is
catching a stack that has genuinely moved on, not policing package naming.

Two findings live here, and the second is the one that matters:

- **Declared but absent** — the config names something the manifest doesn't
  have. Usually a stale config entry.
- **Dominant but undeclared** — a framework or package manager doing obvious
  structural work that `stack` never mentions. Judge this from the manifest's
  scripts and its heaviest dependencies, not from a fixed list. This is the
  check that catches a runtime swap the config never recorded.

Report both as *drift to reconcile*, never as an error — the manifest is always
the truth and the config is what needs updating.

## 5. Repo tooling

**The six stack axes.** Since format 19 a stack is composed from independent
axes — `project`, `backing`, `deploy`, `repo`, `design` and `cicd`
(`assets/stack-adapter.md` holds the enum) — and every one but `repo` is **per
project** (the three technology axes since format 13). Check each pin resolves
to a template an installed stack plugin actually offers:
`projects.<name>.stack.template` (project axis), each entry of
`projects.<name>.stack.backing_template`, `projects.<name>.stack.deploy_template`,
`repo.stack.template`, and the `projects.<name>.design` and
`projects.<name>.cicd` pins, whose slug is the config value itself. A pin naming
a template that isn't there is **drift** — usually a template renamed under the
user's feet, or a stack plugin that was never installed. An axis reading
`unresolved` is not a pin: report the degradation above and resolve nothing. A
**`custom` pin is
`13` drift and blocking**: the value was retired in `config_format` 14, and it
names a stack with no `conventions` for `plan` and `execute` to read and no
`harness` block to check against — remedy `/vwf:setup`, which
walks the axis back through the menu. A project whose
platforms ship through a store rather than to a deploy target (`mobile`,
`tablet`, `desktop`, `auto`) is correct with `deploy_template: []`, not
missing, as is an `iac` platform, which *is* the deploy path. A project
declaring `cli` **pins a deploy template for its package registry** — **which
one is the stack plugin's answer**, and **vwf names no slug on this axis or any
other**, so what this check asserts is that the axis is **answered**, never what
it was answered with.

**A project missing a required axis is a finding.** Every registry project needs
a `template` and a `deploy_template`. On the two list axes *answered* means a
list of slugs **or** `[]` — an absent key and an empty list mean different
things (nobody decided, versus decided: none). A bare `unresolved` on any axis
is **not** answered, and is the degradation above rather than this finding: the
key is present and names the gap out loud, which is the whole difference. A
project declaring a **screen platform** additionally needs `design`,
without which the design adapter halts at import time; every project needs
`cicd`, without which no CI system is pinned and the pipeline generator has
to ask on every run. Report each as
drift naming the project and the axis, and nudge `/vwf:architecture` — never
guess a value, and never copy one project's answer onto another, which is
exactly the product-wide assumption format 13 removed. A config still carrying a
product-wide `backing:`, `deploy:` or `design.tool` key is `12` drift: report it
and nudge `/vwf:setup`.

**A declared backing capability should have a provider.** For each registry
project, read its `capabilities:` and classify each token by the **kind** marked
in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/capability-vocabulary.md`. For every **`B`**
(backing-service) token, check that some entry of that project's
`backing_template` list declares it — resolve each pinned template and read the
`capabilities:` its payload carries. A `B` token no pinned template provides is
a **finding**: name the project, the token, and the pins that were checked. A
project whose `backing_template` reads `unresolved` has no pins to resolve:
report `not checked — no stack resolved` for it rather than every `B` token it
declares as unprovided.

Three rules keep it honest:

- **`F` and `P` tokens are never reported.** A product foundation is the
  product's own code and a project-axis fact belongs to the project template;
  neither has anything to pin, so asking for one is a category error.
- **Consumers follow the publisher.** A capability this project only *consumes*
  is provided by the publishing project's pin, not its own — resolve the
  publisher before reporting (the rule is in the vocabulary asset). A consumer
  with `backing_template: []` is correct, not drift.
- **Never blocking.** Some `B` tokens have no template offering them anywhere in
  the installed plugins, so this would otherwise halt `setup` and `execute` over
  a gap in the template library rather than in the user's repo. Report it and
  nudge `/vwf:architecture`; do not raise it to blocking without deciding that
  separately.

**An `iac` project must be its own repo.** For each registry project declaring
the `iac` platform, resolve its `path` and check which repo's working tree it
falls in (`git -C <path> rev-parse --show-toplevel`). If that resolves to
another project's repo — the monorepo it sits inside, or the multi-repo **base**
itself rather than a member — it is a **blocking** finding: `setup` and
`execute` both halt on it. The rule and its rationale are in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/topologies/`. The remedy is the extraction
`/vwf:setup` writes up as a recommendation; doctor reports and
stops there, as with every other structural change. An `iac` project that is
already its own repo — an independent one, a submodule, or a sibling member —
passes silently.

**Unless the extraction is a recorded decline.** A decline written under
`enforcement:` downgrades this finding to a **degradation**: still reported,
every run, but no longer blocking, so neither `setup` nor `execute` halts on it.
The decline settles the *proposal*, never the *fact* — a product that chose to
keep its `iac` project where it is should keep being told what it costs, and
silencing the finding would leave the most privileged repo in the product
looking clean. Treat it exactly as a declined graph build.

**A project's template must cover its platforms.** Since format 22 a
project-axis template declares the platforms it serves in its own frontmatter,
and a project declares its own in the registry. Every platform the project
declares must appear in its pinned template's list; one that does not is
**blocking**, since `plan` and `execute` would size that surface against
conventions written for something else. A project whose `template` reads
`unresolved` has no list to check against: report `not checked — no stack
resolved` and move on. The common case is a project that was
`fullstack` before the migration and is now `[service, webapp]` — check the pin
rather than assuming the migration got it right.

**mise is mandatory once there is anything to run** — it is both vwf's task
runner (every worktree init, pre-commit and merge goes through it) and the
toolchain manager the §3 checks resolve against. Missing from `PATH` →
**blocking once any axis in the repo is pinned or any harness capability is
claimed**, remedy `curl https://mise.run | sh`. With **no** axis pinned anywhere
and no capability claimed, it is a **degradation**: there is no toolchain to
manage and no harness task to run, so halting `setup` and `execute` over it
would block a product on day one for a stack nobody has chosen yet. A repo with
no `.config/mise*.toml` at all is the same finding one level up, at the same
severity: report it and nudge `/vwf:init`, which materializes the three
unconditional bundles — `mise`, `repo-gates` and `repo-hygiene` — by their
fixed slugs through the stack adapter's `-stack-template` skill. `/vwf:setup`
is not the remedy: it checks whether the repo is shaped and offers
`/vwf:init`, and materializes no tooling itself. That is the coarsest form of
one question — is this repo still shaped the way `/vwf:init` shapes one — and
the section at the end of this file is the fuller version of the same check:
this one fires when the shape is absent, that one when it is behind.

Then check `repo.stack`: the `package_manager` resolves (lockfile present, tool
on `PATH` or in mise config) and each entry in `tools` has its expected marker —
a config file, a mise tool, or a manifest dependency. Absent `repo.stack` block
→ `10` drift; report and nudge `/vwf:setup`.

**`rtk` is recommended, never required.** vwf ships a `PreToolUse` Bash hook
that pipes each command through `rtk hook claude` to cut token cost, and the
hook entry is guarded (`command -v rtk … || true`), so a machine without it
runs correctly and simply pays full price. Missing from `PATH` → a
**degradation**, never blocking: name what it buys and give the remedy
(`brew install --formulae rtk`, or the releases at
<https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk>). This is the one place vwf tells a user the
tool exists at all — without it the hook is silent in both directions, which is
why the finding is worth reporting on every run rather than once.

## The repo shape against its baseline

Part of §5, and the one check that reads the **shape** `/vwf:init` lays down
rather than what `.config/vwf.yaml` declares. A repo drifts from that baseline
by standing still: the adapter's packs move, `/vwf:architecture` names projects
that did not exist when the repo was shaped, and a fresh clone arrives with one
branch. None of that stops the repo working, so **every finding here is
`drift`, and none is blocking** — a repo behind its baseline is out of date,
not broken. All four sub-checks carry the **same remedy, `/vwf:init`**, which
is why §9 prints that line once with the rows that led to it.

**(a) Pack versions.** Read `.claude/stackgen/lock.yaml`, the adapter's
materialization record — its `-sync` skill owns the file, and this check reads
one thing out of it: the `entries:` list. Each entry names the component it
landed for and a `source:` of the form `pack/<type>/<slug>@<version>`; an entry
sourced `generated` carries no version and is skipped, as is everything outside
`entries:`. Compare each recorded version against the version the adapter ships
**now** for that ref, and resolve "now" from the adapter rather than by
guessing: the `-stack-template` payload for a pinned template carries the same
`<type>/<slug>@<version>` composition refs, so a component named there is read
off the payload. A component no pinned template names is read from
`stacks/<type>/<slug>/pack.yaml` inside the installed adapter plugin's own
tree, located from `claude plugin list` the way this section locates `mise` —
vwf's own plugin-root token names vwf and can never spell another plugin's
root. A recorded version **older** than the shipped one is one drift row naming
the component and both versions. A **newer** recorded version is not a finding
here: the adapter went backwards, which is the sync skill's conversation, not
doctor's. **No lockfile at all** is `missing` rather than drift, with the same
remedy — the shape was never laid down here.

**(b) Project ids.** Every registry project has an id, and three surfaces are
generated from it. Slugify each id per the adapter's `assets/ids.md` — the rule
lives there and is not restated here — and check that:

- a task directory `.config/mise/tasks/p/<slug>/` exists;
- the slug appears in `.config/git-conventional-commits.yaml`'s `commitScopes`.
  An **empty** list is not a miss: a single-project repo is meant to leave it
  empty and use no scope, and the shipped config says so;
- when — and only when — `.config/mise.dev.toml` carries `[shell_alias]`
  entries of the `setup-<id>` form, one of them names this slug. A repo whose
  aliases were never laid down is not drifting from them.

Each miss is one drift row naming the project, the surface, and the slug that
was expected. The reverse direction is a row too: a sub-directory of
`.config/mise/tasks/p/` whose segment matches no registry slug is drift worded
**"id source changed: `<dir>` is not a registry id"** — the expected state once
`/vwf:architecture` first writes ids into a repo that was shaped before it, and
a rename a re-run performs. It is never "a pack moved", and never a reason to
suspect the adapter.

**(c) Branches.** `git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/develop`, and the
same for `refs/heads/main`. Either one missing is a drift row: work flows from
a feature branch or a worktree to `develop`, and from `develop` to `main`, and
the repo's own merge tasks refuse a destination branch that does not exist
locally. Remedy `/vwf:init`, which creates the missing branch. A repo with no
commit yet has neither branch and reports one row saying that, not two.

**(d) The environment key.** `.config/mise.toml` sets `REPO_NAME`, and its
value is this repo's own slug rather than the marked position the toolchain
pack ships. Absent or still unfilled is a drift row, remedy `/vwf:init`: that
key is what the user's own shell aliases read, so an unfilled one is quietly
wrong everywhere it is used.

Doctor **writes none of this** — no branch, no directory, no key, no scope.
It reports the rows, gives `/vwf:init` once as the remedy, and stops there, as
it does with every other structural change in this file.
