# Product Foundations

Thirteen concerns every product hits sooner or later. Each has a **default
contract** distilled from the 95octane reference implementation — proposed per
product, never silently assumed: `/vwf:architecture` walks this checklist as
part of its cross-cutting elicitation, records the selection as a
`cross_cutting` token, and `/vwf:blueprint` expands accepted ones into the
canonical contract in `conventions.md` plus the per-entity surfaces each
reference names.

Five of the thirteen are **core** — users & operators, observability,
reliability targets, DR & backup, incident response — the concerns a
production-bound product cannot skip without a recorded, expiring exception.
The other eight are **elective**:
declining one is a recorded decision (the registry simply omits the token), not
an `enforcement:` opt-out. The contract layer here is code-independent; each
reference points at the reference-stack docs for the 95octane realization.

## The checklist

| Foundation           | Default (one line)                                                         | Reference                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users & operators (Core) | Two user classes; document-based RBAC; claims for account-status only  | [users](references/users.md)                               |
| Observability (Core) | Vendor-neutral telemetry, all three signals, trace-correlated logs        | [observability](references/observability.md)               |
| Audit logs           | Privileged + destructive → `audit-store`, `audit-event`, `audit-history`   | [audit-logs](references/audit-logs.md)                     |
| Change logs          | Keep-a-Changelog source of truth → fastlane store metadata                 | [change-logs](references/change-logs.md)                   |
| Background processes | Sync/async per action; durable → worker, ephemeral → service               | [background-processes](references/background-processes.md) |
| Data retention & PII | Delete by default; pseudonymised legal-basis retention; no PII in logs     | [data-retention](references/data-retention.md)             |
| Notifications        | Per-channel contracts (push/email/SMS); triggers live on entities          | [notifications](references/notifications.md)               |
| Runtime settings     | One cached, schema-typed settings document; flags are settings             | [runtime-settings](references/runtime-settings.md)         |
| Rate limiting        | Endpoint-class limits with a uniform 429 contract                          | [rate-limiting](references/rate-limiting.md)               |
| Reliability targets (Core) | Per-service availability + latency SLOs with an error-budget stance  | [reliability-targets](references/reliability-targets.md)   |
| DR & backup (Core)   | RPO/RTO per datastore; automated backups; restore drills on a cadence      | [disaster-recovery](references/disaster-recovery.md)       |
| Cost guardrails      | One budget with 50/90/100% alerts; per-service scaling caps; metered ops   | [cost-guardrails](references/cost-guardrails.md)           |
| Incident response (Core) | Alert-condition table in conventions; runbooks per project; postmortem stubs | [incident-response](references/incident-response.md)   |

## How the workflow consumes this

- **`/vwf:architecture` (step 3c)** — walks the checklist. For each
  **elective** foundation: present the default in one line, ask via MCQ
  **accept the default / adapt it / not applicable**, record the selection as a
  `cross_cutting` token (e.g. `audit: privileged-destructive`,
  `notifications: [push, email]`); a not-applicable answer is omitted from the
  registry — that omission *is* the record. For each **core** foundation the
  MCQ instead offers **accept the default / adapt it / defer — not
  production-bound**: a core foundation has no "not applicable" — a product
  with no reliability target or no DR posture is not a claim vwf lets stand
  silently. A deferral records a registry token `<foundation>: deferred-preprod`
  (e.g. `reliability: deferred-preprod`), never an omission — omission stays
  the record only for electives.
- **`/vwf:plan` (production-bound slice) / `/vwf:verify production`** — treat
  any `deferred-preprod` core token still on the registry as a **blocking**
  finding: the product is shipping to customers on a foundation it explicitly
  said was not ready.
- **`/vwf:blueprint`** — for each accepted (or deferred) foundation, expand the
  contract into `conventions.md` under its anchor (the reference names it) on
  first touch, and elicit the per-flow surface as flows are authored: audit
  markers on the flow's Trigger & Actors rows and steps for
  privileged/destructive actions, notification triggers, sync/async
  classification and placement (the flow's Background Jobs table), settings
  reads. Flow and entity docs link the anchors; they never restate the
  contract.
- **`/vwf:plan` / `execute`** — consume the contracts like any other conventions
  anchor; the change-logs reference additionally hooks execute's docs-sync step.

Foundations expand into **existing** blueprint structures (conventions anchors,
flow Trigger & Actors, Background Jobs, flow steps) — no new mandatory doc
sections, so a product that defers or skips a foundation is not in format
drift.
