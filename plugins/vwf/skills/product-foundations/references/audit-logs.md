# Audit Logs

An **append-only record of who did what to whom, when, and why** — distinct from
observability (traces answer "what happened in the system"; audit answers "which
human/actor is accountable"). Cross-cutting token:
`audit: privileged-destructive` (the default scope).

## Default contract

- **Scope: privileged + destructive.** Every operator/console action, plus any
  destructive or irreversible mutation of user data regardless of actor —
  delete, merge, ban, purge, payout, permission change. Ordinary CRUD stays in
  observability traces; recording everything is a deliberate, elicited widening,
  never the default.
- **Event shape** (every event): actor (id + class: customer/operator/system),
  action (a stable verb from the flow's Trigger & Actors), target (entity + id),
  timestamp, outcome (success/denied/failed), reason (mandatory for operator
  moderation actions — bans, purges), and the correlating trace id.
- **Append-only, never edited or deleted in place** — retention expiry is the
  only removal path, executed as a purge (see data-retention; moderation history
  is itself a retained category with a legal basis).
- **Structurally unavoidable**: privileged mutations pass through an audit layer
  so it is impossible to mutate without an event (the console reference-stack's
  `AuditLogService` pattern) — audit is not a per-endpoint courtesy call.
- **Read surface**: the standard operator flow `audit-history`, in the console
  project — moderation history per user/target, readable by operator roles;
  events referencing retained post-deletion data are compliance-role only.
- **PII discipline**: events reference ids, never copy personal data into the
  event body.

## Elicit per product

This foundation is the least built-out in the reference implementation
(documented intent, no code yet) — elicit rather than assume:

- The event list: walk each flow's Trigger & Actors rows and steps and mark
  which are audit-recorded (all operator actions + destructive steps by
  default).
- Storage: this foundation decides only that audit events are stored
  append-only, access-controlled, and apart from the product's ordinary reads.
  Which store, and whether it is an isolated schema inside the product's own
  database or a separate database of the same engine, belongs to the
  `audit-store` capability the console project pins on its backing axis — the
  backing half of the pair, held apart from this foundation on purpose; the
  realization decides it and states its trade, because the access boundary each
  engine can enforce differs. Elicit if the product needs an external/immutable
  store.
- Retention period per event class (ties into the data-retention table).
- Whether customers get a self-view ("account activity") — off by default.

## Blueprint expansion

- `conventions.md#audit` holds the contract (scope, event shape, storage,
  access); each flow's Trigger & Actors rows and steps carry audit markers.
  Audit-worthy async work (purges, merges) also names its audit event in the
  flow's Background Jobs.
- The event shape becomes the **standard entity `audit-event`**, and the read
  surface the **standard operator flow `audit-history`** in the console
  project. Both are mandatory once this foundation is accepted, and both are
  coverage conditions the blueprint surveyor checks — neither is restated in a
  flow doc, which links the anchor as any other contract does.
