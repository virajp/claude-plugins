# UI / UX Contract (per screen)

Per-screen interaction decisions live in the **flow's** Screens section — the
flow that owns the journey a screen belongs to (see the
[flow-contract](./flow-contract.md)). Every screen is defined in exactly one
flow, its **home** journey; another flow that touches the screen links the home
flow's row rather than redefining it. The product-wide visual and interaction
*language* — tokens, typography, spacing, motion, accessibility standard, global
component behaviors — lives in the **design system**
(`docs/blueprint/design-system.md`, authored by `/vwf:design-system`). Reference
it; never re-decide visual language per screen.

Pin per screen / surface (each has more than one reasonable answer):

- **Navigation & IA** — the screen, its route, entry points, and how the user
  moves to and from it.
- **Interaction pattern per action** — modal vs inline vs full-page; single vs
  multi-step; optimistic vs pessimistic feedback; confirmation and undo for
  destructive actions.
- **State UX** — loading, empty (first-run vs no-results), error (placement +
  how the user recovers), success, partial/pending. **Error and empty are
  mandatory pins for every screen** (or an explicit `n/a — <why>`): the sad
  paths are contract, not optional variants — they are what the blueprint flow
  pass renders for visual review and `/vwf:mockups` draws. Pin equally the
  **conditional product states** the screen genuinely has — not sad paths but
  states of the product (empty data, an entity lifecycle-state variant): on the
  canvas each pinned sad and conditional state becomes a tweak on its screen.
  Use the design system's global state patterns; record only deviations.
- **Form UX** — field order, validation timing (on-blur vs on-submit), inline
  error placement, required indicators, autosave vs explicit save.
- **Components & rules** — the elements the screen displays (text, info, error
  surfaces, buttons, inputs, lists, media), each with its rules: the conditions
  under which it is visible or enabled (a button clickable only when the form
  validates), what activating it does (the operation called or the coded screen
  reached), and its content where the wording is a product decision. Recorded as
  the screen's **Components block** (format 12) under the Screens table, headed
  by the row's code; `/vwf:screens prompt` transcribes it into the design brief.
  Kinds and behavior only — the component library and styling stay realization.
- **Feedback & realtime** — toast/banner/progress choice; whether data updates
  live or on refresh (the UX expectation, not the transport).
- **Content** — error messages, empty-state copy, and CTA labels where the
  wording is a product decision.
- **Metadata** (`site` and `webapp` screens only — the Metadata block, format
  25; see the [flow-contract](./flow-contract.md)) — what the page says about
  itself: its `title`, its `description`, whether it is offered to search
  (`index`), and the picture a shared link shows (`image`). The picture and the
  product's mark are **not** re-decided here: the social preview and the
  favicon mark are the design system's **brand assets**, and a screen writes
  `image: <slot>` only when it genuinely has art of its own — otherwise
  `image: default`. Wording is a product decision and belongs here; the tags
  that carry it are realization.
- **In-car screens** (screens in a flow's `auto.md` platform file — the in-car
  take is a platform file of the same flow, never a separate flow; see the
  [flow-contract](./flow-contract.md)) — per in-car screen: the OS **template**
  it maps to (list / grid / map / now-playing / …), the glanceable content
  subset vs the phone screen, interaction limits while driving, and any
  CarPlay-vs-Android-Auto difference (both live in `auto.md`). In-car UIs are
  template-constrained by the OS — custom layout and visual language do not
  apply; the design system reaches only as far as the platform allows (icons,
  accent color).

Out (realization): the component library, CSS, exact pixels — and anything
already fixed by the design system. If a screen must break the design system,
record the deviation and why **here**, in the flow's Screens section — do not
fork the design system.
