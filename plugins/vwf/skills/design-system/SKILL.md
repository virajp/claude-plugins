# design-system — Import the Product's Design System

**The design tool owns design-system authoring.** You pick or build the design
system there — vwf imports it through the design adapter and never authors
visual language. Which tool answers (`claude-design`,
`lovable`, `stitch`, …) is the product's choice; vwf knows only the payload
shape, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/design-adapter.md`. The canvas is where
visual language is judged. This skill does one job: resolve the design system,
**import** it into `docs/blueprint/design-system.md`, and **pin**
`design.design_system_id` in `.config/vwf.yaml`.

The repo doc still matters — it is the **offline contract**: the design-system
reviewer bar, the execute ux gate, and the coder consume it without network or
claude.ai auth, and it is git-versioned and graphify-ingestable. The doc records
the *decisions* — semantic token values, type and spacing scales, motion
principles, the accessibility standard, global component behaviors — never the
component library, CSS framework, or design-file mechanics (that is `plan`).

**Drift is one-way.** The canvas is the source; the doc is its distillation.
Hand-edits to the doc are drift — resolved by changing the design system on the
canvas and re-running this skill, never by publishing the doc back.

## Pipeline

### 1. Read the registry

Read `docs/blueprint/registry.yaml`. **Halt if it does not exist:** "No registry
found. Run `/vwf:architecture` first." If the registry has **no** project
declaring a **screen platform** (`site`, `webapp`, `desktop`, `mobile`,
`tablet`, `auto`), the run takes the **text-only path**: tell the user no
project has a screen surface and ask whether to (a) **add the UI project to the
registry first** via `/vwf:architecture` (then return here), or (b) proceed
text-only. On (b), **skip §3 and §4 entirely** — the adapter exists for screens
and there are none — and elicit the doc directly at §5.

**Format check.** Run the preflight in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/format-check.md`; if the repo's blueprint format
is behind what vwf ships, nudge `/vwf:setup` (proceed unless a needed artifact
is missing).

**Terminal surfaces.** Read `platforms:` in `docs/blueprint/registry.yaml`: any
project declaring `cli` makes the doc's **Terminal UX** section required
(design-system-authoring's terminal-ux reference) — always elicited in text
(§5); the canvas neither designs nor imports it.

### 2. Recall (mempalace)

Per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/memory.md`, recall prior design decisions and
rationale (room `decisions`), plus parked visual/UX points (room `gaps`, tag
`parked`). Skip silently if mempalace is unavailable.

### 3. Preflight the design adapter — or halt

**Skipped entirely on the text-only path** (§1: no project declares a screen
platform). The adapter is only ever needed for screens, so preflighting it for
a repo with none halts on a condition that is vacuously true — a `cli`-or-
`plugin`-only product could otherwise never get a design system at all, while
still owing the **Terminal UX** section §1 marks required.

vwf does not talk to any design tool. Per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/design-adapter.md`, the tool is a **per-project**
key — `projects.<name>.design` in `.config/vwf.yaml` — resolved inside the
adapter, not here. **Name the project you are importing for**: read the `design`
value of every project declaring a screen platform; when they
all agree, use that project and say which. When they disagree, ask which
project's tool authors the product's one design system — that is a product
decision, not something to pick silently. Then **verify the repo's own
`design-import-design-system` skill exists** before delegating — that is what
the project's `design:` pin materializes, and its absence is the one failure
that otherwise reads as an empty design. Three distinct halts — never collapsed
into one, since each needs a different fix:

- **No `design` on any screen-platform project** → "No design tool configured.
  Set `projects.<name>.design` in `.config/vwf.yaml` to one of the options the
  design-axis stack menu offers." A config still carrying a product-wide
  `design.tool` is `config_format` 12 drift — nudge `/vwf:setup` rather than
  reading it.
- **Pin not materialized** → "the repo has no `design-import-design-system`
  skill. Materialize the project's `design` pin, then re-run."
- **Adapter returns nothing usable** → "`<tool>` returned no usable payload",
  with the parse error.

The preflight exists because the failure is **silent**: an adapter skill set to
`disable-model-invocation: true` cannot be invoked programmatically and does not
error, so attempting the call and inspecting the result cannot distinguish
"missing adapter" from "empty design system". Its **only** offline mode is the
text-only path above, which exists because there are no screens to import —
never as a fallback when an adapter is missing for a product that has some.

### 4. Delegate the import

**Skipped on the text-only path** — there is no payload to import; §5 elicits
every section instead.

Invoke `/vwf:import-design-system` and parse its reply as a **design-system
payload** per the adapter contract. Everything downstream is vwf's job: you
write `docs/blueprint/design-system.md` from the payload, gated by the
`design-system-reviewer` — the adapter never touches a blueprint doc.

**Record `source.derived`.** When the adapter reports `derived: true`, it
reconstructed the tokens from generated code rather than reading a stored design
system. Note that in the doc: a stored system is authoritative until someone
changes it, a derived one is a snapshot of one generation and can drift the next
time a screen is regenerated.

If the payload carries a tool-side identifier, pin it under `design:` for the
next run (per the vwf-config asset — the pin is adapter-scoped, since every tool
identifies its design system differently).

### 5. Distill into the doc

Map the payload onto the template's sections: semantic token values, type &
spacing scales, motion, accessibility, component behaviors, anti-patterns.
**Contract vs realization** holds — values and scales, never the component
library or CSS framework the payload may mention.

**On the text-only path there is no payload**, so every section is elicited
here per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/elicitation.md`, starting with **Terminal
UX** (design-system-authoring's terminal-ux reference) for a product whose only
surface is a terminal. Elicit only the sections the product's platforms oblige;
a doc full of screen tokens no screen uses is the density bar's problem.

**Nothing invented.** A field the adapter returned as `null`, or a section no
tool decided (commonly the accessibility conformance target, anti-patterns, or
the Terminal UX section when a `cli` platform requires it) is **elicited now**,
per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/elicitation.md`. The import fills the doc;
elicitation fills only the import's holes. Never fill a `null` by inference —
the adapter reported it as unknown precisely so it would not be guessed.

### 6. Write the doc

Two equal forms — **single file** `docs/blueprint/design-system.md` (default),
or the **folder** `docs/blueprint/design-system/` (`index.md` +
`foundations.md` + `motion.md` + `components.md`) once it outgrows one sitting;
an existing folder stays a folder. Author from the template with its **OKF
frontmatter** (`type: vwf-design-system`, `title`, `description`, `status` —
`draft` until §7 passes, then `reviewed`); every split file carries its own
frontmatter.

### 7. Reviewer loop (fresh subagent)

Self-review against the design-system-authoring checklist first. Then loop:
dispatch a **fresh** `design-system-reviewer` (stateless) with only the written
doc (all files of the folder form; tell it whether a `cli` platform exists).
**Gaps** → a decision hole is elicited and fixed in the doc; a *visual* gap is
tool-side rework — the user iterates in their design tool, then re-import the
affected sections. **`NO GAPS`** → `status: reviewed`. Convergence guard: pause
and ask if the gap count does not strictly decrease.

### 8. Reconcile & persist

**Impact analysis (re-import).** When the import **renamed or removed** a token
or component behavior, grep `docs/blueprint/` — the flow docs' Screens sections
and References — for the old name and report every orphan; offer to fix them via
`/vwf:blueprint`. Never edit a flow doc from here.

**Cross-cutting conventions.** A theming/dark-mode strategy or an i18n/RTL
decision graduates to `conventions.md`; pure token/scale/behavior values never
do.

**Architecture reconcile.** A product-shape change surfaced here (e.g. a new UI
project) routes through `/vwf:architecture` — never a by-hand registry edit.

**Persist.** Store durable decisions and rationale to mempalace room `decisions`
(skip what the doc captures verbatim; skip silently if down).

### 9. Approval gate, pin & commit

Summarize what was imported/changed and wait for explicit approval. Then pin
`design.design_system_id` in `.config/vwf.yaml` (confirmed, never silently) and
hand **all** git actions to `/vwf:git-workflow` — the pin rides the same commit.
Use a `blueprint(design-system):` or `docs(design-system):` message.
