# Platforms & Terminal Surfaces

Read this at step 3b when settling a project's `platforms:` — which since format
22 is **every** project, not only UI ones. A project carries one `role` (the
coarse domain grouping) and **one or more platforms** from that role's closed
list, and the platforms are what everything downstream keys on.

## The vocabulary

Record each project's implemented surfaces under its `platforms:` in
**`registry.yaml`** — the single source since format 19; the key no longer
appears in `.config/vwf.yaml`. The closed per-role lists live in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/templates/registry.yaml`, and the screen-platform
semantics in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/standard-flows.md`:

| Role       | Offer                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backend`  | `packages`, `service`, `worker`, `webapp`                                    |
| `frontend` | `packages`, `site`, `webapp`, `desktop`, `mobile`, `tablet`, `auto`, `cli`   |
| `data`     | `packages`, `data-lake`, `analytics`, `ingestion`, `ml-platform`             |
| `system`   | `packages`, `iac`, `plugin`, `misc`, `cicd`, `cli`                           |

**A project may declare several.** One Flutter codebase shipping phone, tablet,
desktop and web is **one** project with `platforms: [mobile, tablet, desktop,
webapp]` — not four projects. Flows are keyed on project name, so splitting it
would triplicate every flow doc. Likewise a server that publishes an API and
serves its own UI is `backend` / `platforms: [service, webapp]`, which is what
the retired `fullstack` role meant. `webapp` sits under `backend` as well as
`frontend` for exactly that project, the way `cli` sits under two roles: the
deployable is a backend whose UI rides along on the same origin, and typing it
`frontend` would claim a role its API-first purpose does not have.

Ask once per project whether the app must run in-car, and offer **`auto`**
(CarPlay and Android Auto together) only where it makes sense. A native client
that talks to *another* project's API is its own project, not a platform of that
one — the test is whether it is a separate codebase, not whether it is a
separate surface.

The vocabulary names form factors, not vendors — `mobile` already hides
iOS/Android, so `auto` hides CarPlay/Android Auto the same way.

## What the platforms decide

Everything that used to key on `role` now keys on these:

| Platform(s) | Obliges |
| --- | --- |
| `site` `webapp` `desktop` `mobile` `tablet` `auto` | **screen platforms** — design system mandatory, standard flows mandated, one `<platform>.md` per flow, `/vwf:screens` briefs, canvas pins, mockups |
| `service` | `apis/<project>.openapi.yaml` and a health endpoint |
| `iac` | registered, exempt from blueprint coverage, **always its own repo** |
| `plugin` | **covered** — flows are the extension points, one per skill/command/hook, `index.md` alone, no standard-flow mandates |
| every other `data` and `system` platform | exempt from blueprint coverage |
| everything else | a flow is `index.md` alone |

**`site` vs `webapp`.** `site` is a browser-delivered **content** surface — a
marketing, docs or landing site. `webapp` is the browser-delivered
**application**. A product with both declares both; they are separate surfaces
with separate screens and often separate design projects, which the
retired `web` token could not express (format 22 split it).

## Terminal surfaces

While walking the projects, ask (once) whether any exposes a **CLI/TUI** — a
shipped command-line tool, not internal dev scripts. For each that does, offer
`cli` among its platforms. A terminal surface has no screens, so `cli`
never admits a `cli.md` platform file and never triggers Screens, mockups, or
the canvas; what it does require is the design system's **Terminal UX** section.
A CLI-only tool is `platforms: [ cli ]` — and is exempt from the standard-flows
mandates, since `splash` and `home` are screen journeys it does not have. A
project mixing `cli` with a screen platform is **not** exempt: the screen
platform brings the mandates with it.

**`cli` sits under two roles, and the question is who the tool serves.** A CLI
the product's *end users* run is `frontend` — it is a user-facing surface that
happens to be textual. A CLI that exists to build, scaffold, install or deliver
something else is `system`: "infrastructure and tooling" is exactly what that
is, and typing it `frontend` forces it to claim a user-facing role it does not
have. Ask which it is rather than defaulting; an installer is the clear
`system` case, a `git`-like tool the clear `frontend` one.

**Nothing downstream keys on that choice.** Every gate reads the platform
token, not the role: Terminal UX, the screens/mockups exemption, the fact that
a `cli` platform pins a deploy template for its package registry — which one is
the stack plugin's answer — and blueprint coverage, which excepts `cli`
alongside `plugin` precisely so the role cannot silently change it. Picking the
wrong role misdescribes the project; it does not misconfigure it.
