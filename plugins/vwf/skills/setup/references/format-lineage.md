# Format Lineage

Every spelling vwf has retired, and what it is called now. Read this while
reconciling a repo authored against an older format: such a tree usually names
things *correctly for the format it was written in* and wrongly for this one,
and that difference is a rename to recognise, not a gap to fill.

This file replaces the per-format delta ladder. Reconciliation is
**state-based** — diff the tree against the current format's definition sources
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/templates/`,
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/examples/blueprint/`, the blueprint-authoring bars, and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/vwf-config.md`) and fix what differs. The table below
exists only so a retired spelling resolves to the thing it became rather than
registering as something unknown.

## What the stamps mean now

`blueprint_format` (**24**) and `config_format` (**18**) are **drift
detectors** and nothing else. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/format-check.md` compares
a repo's stamps against the shipped integers and nudges
`/vwf:setup`. Nothing selects a migration path by them any more,
and there is no support window: a repo stamped `2` and a repo stamped `21`
reconcile against the same current format, by the same algorithm, in one pass.

**Both lines skip 17, and the blueprint line also skips 13.** A repo whose
`blueprint_format` reads 13 is treated as 12; one whose `blueprint_format` or
`config_format` reads 17 is treated as **16** on that line — `config_format`
went 16 → 18 when `enforcement.kept_files` arrived. The two stamps are separate
number lines and never comparable, and 13 is skipped on one of them only:
`config_format` 13 is real.

## The lineage table

A **fan-out** row maps one retired token onto more than one current spelling and
must go through the rule below. Every other row is mechanical.

| Retired spelling | Current spelling | Kind | Fan-out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace`, then `polyrepo` | `multi-repo` plus `linkage: submodule` | topology | |
| a project's `type:` key | `role:` | role | |
| `api`, `service` | `backend` + `platforms: [ service ]` | role | |
| `worker` | `backend` + `[ worker ]` | role | |
| `web` (as a role), `site` | `frontend` + `[ site ]` | role | yes |
| a `site` that publishes its own API contract | `backend` + `[ service, webapp ]` | role | yes |
| `console`, `fullstack` | `backend` + `[ service, webapp ]` + the `operator-rbac` capability | role | |
| `app`, `frontend` on screen platforms | `frontend` + its own platform list | role | |
| `frontend` whose only platform is `cli` | `frontend` + `[ cli ]` | role | |
| `infra`, then `iac` | `system` + `[ iac ]` | role | |
| `library`, `packages` | `[ packages ]` under **any** role — the consumer decides | role | yes |
| `web` (as a platform) | `site` or `webapp` | platform | yes |
| `carplay`, `android-auto` | `auto` | platform | |
| `desktop` on a content-surface project | `web`, then `site` or `webapp` | platform | yes |

| `docs/blueprint/<entity>.md`, or `<entity>/` at the blueprint root | `entities/<entity>/index.md` + `schema.yaml` | file-location | |
| entity `data.md` / `api.md` / `jobs.md` / `screens.md` | `index.md` + `schema.yaml`, `apis/<project>.openapi.yaml`, and the owning flow's Screens and Jobs | file-location | yes |
| a single-file entity's `## Data Model` table | `schema.yaml` — Field/Type/Optional/Default/Validation become `properties`/`required`/`default`, unmappable prose the property's `description` | file-location | |
| a single-file entity's `## API Surface` table | `apis/<project>.openapi.yaml`, one operation per row with a generated `operationId` | file-location | |
| `docs/blueprint/integration.md` | `flows/index.md` plus one `flows/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/index.md` per flow | file-location | |
| `architecture.md`'s `## Project Registry` and `## Cross-cutting Decisions` | `registry.yaml` (`projects`, `cross_cutting`) | file-location | |

| a `mempalace.yaml` per repo, or one under `.config/` | exactly one per mined tree, at that tree's root | file-location | |
| an entity's `Serves:` line | `Used by:`, linking the flows that use it (flows keep `Serves:`) | doc-section | |
| `## Consistency boundary`, `## Failure handling`, `## Idempotency`, and links to them | one `## Guarantees` table, anchored `#guarantees` | doc-section | |

| the registry's `deviations:` block | the config's `enforcement:` block | doc-section | |
| `stage-*` / `prod-*` tag globs in `conventions.md#pipeline` | `<project>-stage-v<semver>` / `<project>-prod-v<semver>` | doc-section | |
| a secrets or env-var **catalog** under `conventions.md#config` | `docs/blueprint/environment.md`; `#config` keeps only the injection mechanism | doc-section | |
| type `vwf-integration` on a root `integration.md` | the same token, now the type of `flows/index.md` — the spelling never changed, its referent did | doc-section | |
| a Risks-table `Validated by` cell (or no validation column at all) | `Validation method` + `Status` + `Evidence` columns — old text maps onto the closed method vocabulary (the product skill's `references/validation.md`); `Status` is `untested` unless the row already carries evidence | doc-section | yes |
| a Slice priority table with no `Validates` column | a `Validates` column naming the Risks row the slice validates — `—` when it validates none | doc-section | |
| a goal with no `Re-evaluate if:` line | the first goal gains one — `<metric> below <floor> by <date> → kill / pivot / re-scope` — elicited, never invented | doc-section | yes |
| a free-text `Measured via:` line | one of the four structured forms (`counter <flow-slug>.<outcome>`, `counter <entity>.<state>`, `store-metric <intent>`, `external <source>`) — propose from the old text, confirm where ambiguous; a `counter` form is also declared beside the owning flow's Acceptance block or entity's Lifecycle table | doc-section | yes |
| a flow Guarantees row with no `Load & latency` cell | the cell, defaulted to the token `default — per conventions#reliability` | doc-section | |
| an entity doc with no `Scale:` line | a `Scale:` line — count order-of-magnitude at a stated horizon plus the growth driver — elicited | doc-section | yes |
| an externally-triggered or payment/entitlement-mutating flow with no abuse-case criterion | one abuse-case Given/When/Then in Acceptance, or `n/a — <why>` — elicited | doc-section | yes |
| a core foundation skipped by omission in the registry | accepted (or adapted), or an explicit `<foundation>: deferred-preprod` token — elicited, never defaulted | doc-section | yes |
| a registry `capabilities` block with no trust-boundary abuse notes | one worst-plausible-abuse line per trust boundary (external caller, webhook, file upload) — elicited | doc-section | yes |
| a `conventions.md#reliability` carrying SLOs only | plus expected user count and aggregate request rate at a stated horizon — elicited on first touch | doc-section | yes |
| `conventions.md#baseline` ending at rule 15 | rule 16, `baseline/expand-contract` | doc-section | |
| released-API snapshots only under `apis/released/` | plus per-entity `schema.yaml` snapshots in `apis/released/entities/` — written by the next production `/vwf:verify`, nothing to migrate | doc-section | |
| `conventions.md#pipeline` ending at rule 5 | rules 6–8 — `pipeline/load-proven`, `pipeline/rollback-path`, `pipeline/dependency-audit` | doc-section | |
| no `conventions.md#incidents` section | the alert-conditions table (condition → destination → runbook), once the incident foundation is accepted | doc-section | |
| an entity's `Actors & Actions` section | retired — actors are the owning flow's Trigger & Actors | retirement | |
| ungrouped, unnumbered flow folders | `flows/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/`, gap-numbered by 10 | numbering | |
| numbers assigned per device subgroup | one number line per project | numbering | |
| any number on a standard flow | its designated number (`010`/`020`/`030`/`040`, `100`, `910`–`940`); everything else into `110`–`890`, existing order preserved | numbering | |
| a screen code carrying the old flow number (`010a`) | re-coded to the new number (`100a`), letters and order kept | numbering | |
| a synonym flow slug (`login`, `dashboard`, …) | the standard slug in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/standard-flows.md` | numbering | yes |
| a standard flow's primary screen name (`Dashboard`) | the flow's slug (`home`) | numbering | yes |
| canvas page names `010-signin--mobile`, `--carplay` | `020-signin--mobile`, `--auto` — this targets canvas state, not the repo tree | numbering | |
| `pipeline.autopilot_caps` | `pipeline.execute_caps` | config-key | |
| `mockups:`, `mockups.project_id` | `design:`, `design.project_id` | config-key | |
| `design.project_id`, a flat `design.projects.<project>` | `design.projects.<project>.<platform>` | config-key | yes |
| `design.design_system_id` tied to a mockup project's uuid | the same key, now its own canvas project, one per product — a value equal to one of `design.projects`' uuids is the drift signal | config-key | |
| `design.flows_pushed` | `design.flows_rendered` | config-key | |
| `design.tool` | `projects.<name>.design`, on UI projects only | config-key | |
| product-wide `backing:` / `deploy:` | `projects.<name>.stack.backing_template` (a list) / `deploy_template` | config-key | |
| a project's `stack:` key in the registry | `projects.<name>.stack` in the config — the registry carries no stack at all | config-key | |
| no CI axis anywhere — there was never a product-wide `cicd:` to move down | `projects.<name>.cicd`, detected once from the repo and confirmed | config-key | yes |
| `projects.<name>.platforms` in the config | the registry's `platforms:` — the single source | config-key | yes |
| `ui:` computed from a project's UI **role** | the same key, now true when some project declares a screen platform — recompute it from the registry rather than trusting a stale `true` on a `cli`-only product | config-key | |
| `enforcement.stacks` | retired — `projects.<name>.stack` plus its `note` | config-key | |
| `projects.<name>.stack_reason` | `projects.<name>.stack.note`, carried verbatim | config-key | |
| a flat **list** at `projects.<name>.stack` | the structured block — `template`, `languages`, `frameworks`, `dependencies`, split per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-vocabulary.md` | config-key | |
| `enforcement.structure` | retired — `topology` plus `topology_reason` | config-key | |
| no `enforcement.kept_files` block | `kept_files: {}` — the block format 18 introduced; nothing is retired and nothing converts, an absent block reading as empty | config-key | |
| a flow id carrying a `<device>` segment, or missing its `<platform>` leaf | `<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>` | config-key | |
| `environments` keys `dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod` | `development`, `staging`, `production` — `test` has no single canonical partner; propose, never auto-fix | config-key | yes |
| mempalace rooms `plans`, `decision` | `planning`, `decisions` | config-key | |

Two notes the table cannot carry. **vwf ships no stack templates**: a
`project/<slug>` pin resolves through a stack plugin
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stack-adapter.md`), so a retired path is repinned from a
menu, never rewritten by hand. And **renaming a mempalace room in the config
does not move drawers already filed under the old name** — report what was found
and let the user decide; a format reconcile never rewrites a live palace.

## The fan-out rule

A retired token that maps to more than one current spelling is **never picked
silently**. Resolve each one in three steps:

1. **Read the evidence.** The recognition tables in `topology-detection.md` say
   what each current spelling looks like on disk. Judge the directory, not the
   name it used to carry.
2. **Propose** the mapping that evidence supports, quoting the evidence that
   supports it.
3. **Confirm by MCQ**, one decision per round per
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/elicitation.md`, with the other candidates offered.

Where no evidence separates the candidates, ask outright rather than defaulting.
Old role `packages` is the case that proves the rule: `packages` is now a
platform available under every role, the role names the package's primary
consumer domain, and nothing about the package's behaviour changes either way —
so a wrong answer here is invisible forever.
