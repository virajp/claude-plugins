# Design System

The product-wide **UX and visual language, as a contract**. It is a vwf
foundation — a peer of `architecture.md` — and is **mandatory once the product
has a UI surface** (a frontend/app project in the registry). Every blueprint
Screens section references it instead of re-deciding color, type, spacing, or
component behavior.

A design system records decisions that are **true regardless of framework**:
semantic token *values*, type and spacing *scales*, motion *principles*, and the
*accessibility standard* the product commits to. It never names the component
library, CSS framework, or design file — that mapping is realization (`plan`).
