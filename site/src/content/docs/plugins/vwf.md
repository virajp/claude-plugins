title: "vwf plugin"
description: "The flagship plugin: an opinionated Product, Blueprint, Plan, Execute workflow with post-deploy verification and a production-feedback intake, documented command by command."
order: 1
---

The flagship plugin of the `virajp-plugins` marketplace — an opinionated
workflow that turns a vague idea into a shipped, reviewed product through four
disciplined phases: **Product → Blueprint → Plan → Execute**, with post-deploy
verification and a production-feedback intake closing the loop.

This is the full manual. For the short pitch and the rest of the marketplace,
see [readme.md](https://github.com/virajp/claude-plugins/blob/main/readme.md).

This page is the reference, command by command. If you would rather follow one
product's whole walk through the workflow, the journey-shaped guides are in
[docs/how-to](../how-to/index.md), organized by the situation you are in.

## Install

```sh
# Once
claude plugin marketplace add virajp/claude-plugins

# Installs vwf and its one dependency, stackgen
claude plugin install vwf@virajp-plugins
```

Add `--scope project` to either command to keep it to one repo. Restart the
agent afterwards, then run **`/vwf:doctor`** — nothing is verified at install
time, and doctor is what reports a missing required binary.

Any `pnpx @virajp.dev/claude-plugins` install also wires up **graphify**, which
vwf enforces at its own entry gate. Installing outside a git repo works too:
`graphify install` still runs, and its repo-scoped post-commit hook is skipped
automatically (with a note).

Separately, `brew install virajp/tap/claude-status` installs the statusline —
and with it the caps hook that delivers `/vwf:execute`'s resource-cap pause. See
[/vwf:execute](#vwfexecute).

Restart Claude Code afterward so the commands, hooks, and dependencies load.

## Prerequisites

`vwf` shells out to a few external tools. Install them first — nothing checks
them at install time, and the table below gives the command for each.

| Tool            | Required?    | Why                                             | Install                               |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| mise            | **required** | task runner + resolves the toolchain            | `brew install mise`                   |
| graphify        | **required** | knowledge graph the commands rely on            | `mise use -g pipx:graphifyy@latest`   |
| node + pnpm     | **required** | runs vwf's Context7 MCP server (default runner) | `mise use -g node@latest pnpm@latest` |
| Claude Code CLI | **required** | hosts the commands                              | `mise use -g claude-code@latest`      |
| uv              | **required** | graphify's Python runtime                       | `mise use -g uv@latest`               |
| rtk             | recommended  | the token-saving `rtk hook claude` Bash hook    | `brew install --formulae rtk`         |

**Nothing checks these at install time.** `claude plugin install vwf` succeeds
regardless, so the first thing to run afterwards is **`/vwf:doctor`** — it
reports a missing required one as a **blocking** finding, and both `/vwf:setup`
and `/vwf:execute` halt on one — with one condition on `mise` since
`config_format` 16: with no stack axis pinned anywhere and no harness capability
claimed there is nothing for it to resolve, so its absence degrades rather than
blocks until one is. An earlier installer refused the install outright and
printed the command to fix each; that gate did not come back when the
installer's plugin flags did, so the failure now arrives at first use rather
than at install. `rtk` is the exception — the hook entry is guarded, so a `vwf`
without `rtk` still runs correctly and merely costs more, and `/vwf:doctor`
reports it as a **degradation** every run rather than blocking.

**The memory server runs as your own daemon.** `vwf` declares mempalace over
**HTTP** (`http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`), not as a stdio subprocess — start it
with
`mempalace-mcp --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --palace "$HOME/.local/share/mempalace"`
(loopback needs no token), under a process supervisor. Not `mempalace serve`:
`serve` forks the real server as a child and holds PID 1 itself, so under a
supervisor the server never sees `SIGTERM`. One daemon serves every agent
instance at once, survives session restarts, and reconnects instead of dying
with the session. If you separately install the upstream `mempalace` plugin,
toggle **its** stdio server off in `/mcp` — two servers writing one palace lose
each other's local graph state. See [mempalace](./mempalace.md).

Nothing else about memory needs installing. The two mempalace skills are
**vendored into `vwf`** (`/vwf:mempalace`, `/vwf:mempalace-recall`) and its
auto-save hooks are reimplemented here, so memory arrives with the plugin rather
than depending on anything being reachable at install time.

`vwf` also depends on one plugin — `stackgen` — resolved from the same
`virajp-plugins` marketplace. Claude Code **auto-installs and auto-enables** it
when you enable `vwf` (requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.143). `devtools` was a second
dependency until it dissolved into `stackgen`; if your machine still has it,
`claude plugin uninstall devtools` — an upgrade stops listing it but leaves it
enabled, shadowing the stackgen packs its skills moved into.

`stackgen` is a dependency because vwf's stack menu is the union of what the
installed stack plugins declare, and the six axes carry no *other (describe)*
option — so with no stack plugin present, `/vwf:architecture` asks a question
you cannot answer. Having it installed costs nothing if you are not ready to
choose a stack: stackgen acts only when an axis is pinned.

The Markdown/documentation skills and the Context7 docs server used to be two
more dependencies. They are **part of `vwf` now**: `documentation-standards` and
`/vwf:readme` are vwf skills, and Context7 is one of vwf's two MCP servers. The
Karpathy coding guidelines were a third, and are now a **vendored** skill —
`karpathy-guidelines` — for the same reason mempalace's are: as a url-sourced
dependency it was silently absent for most installs, and vendoring puts the
provenance beside the code it governs.

**No CI plugin is among them.** vwf states the delivery-pipeline *contract* —
what a deploy must guarantee, never how it is spelled — and the CI system pinned
on a project's `cicd` axis implements it. Since the `cicd` plugin dissolved,
that system arrives as a [`stackgen`](./stackgen.md) `ci-system` bundle, which
installs with vwf as its dependency.

**A design tool is not among them.** vwf is decoupled from any particular one,
and since Wave D it names none at all. It delegates screen, design-system and
review-conversation imports to three of its own fixed skills, which in turn
delegate to three more fixed names in **the repo's own `.claude/`** —
`design-import-screens`, `design-import-design-system` and
`design-import-conversations`. Those are what the project's `design:` pin
materializes from a stack `design-tool` pack, resolved **per project**, so a
product can design its website with one tool and its app with another.

Adding a tool is a pack and a menu entry in the stack plugin, never a vwf
change. Export needs no adapter at all, since `/vwf:screens prompt` just writes
design briefs as files.

## Caveats

`vwf` is deliberately heavyweight. Know what you're signing up for before
adopting it.

**Model & cost**

- **Built for a large context window.** The orchestrator holds a lot at once:
  the blueprint, the plan, the registry, and each subagent's output. Run Claude
  Code with the **1-million-token** context; the standard window will degrade or
  overflow on a real cycle.
- **Model and effort are tiered per surface, not uniform.** `opus` runs where
  judgment decides the outcome (`product`, `blueprint`, `plan`, the
  `blueprint-reviewer` and `blueprint-coherence-reviewer` gates) or where nobody
  is watching — `execute` is the only unattended command, and its
  `execute-coder`, code-review, security-review, and ux subagents are all `opus`
  too. `sonnet` runs the remaining commands and the writer/surveyor subagents;
  `haiku` runs the two purely mechanical ones (`archive`, `recall`). Effort
  follows the same logic rather than sitting at maximum everywhere: a stronger
  model reaches the same answer in fewer reasoning tokens, so capability and
  effort are traded against each other per surface instead of both being maxed.
  No gate is weakened — every review stage still runs, and config can never
  disable one.
- **Read-heavy work is delegated to keep the orchestrator fast.** Coverage
  scans, the desired-vs-actual codebase survey, and the bulk doc writing run in
  subagents (`blueprint-surveyor`, `plan-surveyor`, `flow-writer`,
  `entity-writer`) that return conclusions rather than file contents. Anything
  the orchestrator loads is re-processed on every later turn of the pass, so
  keeping scans out of its context compounds across a sweep.
- **High token cost.** An `execute` cycle runs several subagents per step — the
  coder, code review and security review all on `opus`, plus E2E acceptance and
  UX conformance when the slice warrants them — with fix loop-backs. The coder
  is the dominant consumer: it runs per step and per fix round, so `opus` there
  is the single largest cost in the workflow. The wager is that better code
  means fewer `code → review` rounds, and round count drives a cycle's length
  more than per-token latency does. Independent stages also run concurrently —
  review ‖ security per step, all per-doc blueprint reviewers in one round —
  which cuts wall-clock but not spend. Expect a meaningful cost per slice; this
  is not a cheap workflow.

**Dependencies**

- **External prerequisites, checked at run time rather than install time.**
  `mise`, `graphify`, `uv`, `pnpm` and `rtk` must be on your `PATH`. Nothing
  refuses the install any more; `/vwf:setup` and `/vwf:execute` halt on a
  missing `graphify` — and on `mise` once a stack is pinned — `/vwf:doctor`
  reports a missing `rtk` as a **degradation**, and `uv` and `pnpm` fail later
  in their own ways. Dependency auto-install/enable needs Claude Code ≥ 2.1.143.
  See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
- **Memory is written twice, so mempalace is optional.** Every memory write goes
  to both `mempalace` (an **HTTP daemon you run** —
  `mempalace-mcp --transport http`) and a markdown tree under `docs/memory/`.
  Without the daemon nothing is lost, but recall degrades from semantic search
  to grep, and says so. `decisions`, `planning`, `gaps` and `problems` are
  committed; `handoff`, `doctor` and `runs` are gitignored, being one
  developer's state rather than the team's.
- **Leans on review engines.** `execute`'s code- and security-review stages run
  on the `/code-review` and `/security-review` engines, falling back to their
  own manual review dimensions when an engine is unavailable.

**Fit**

- **High-touch where it matters, autonomous where it doesn't.** The authoring
  phases (product, architecture, design-system, blueprint, plan) ask one
  question at a time and gate on your approval — plan for interactive sessions.
  `/vwf:execute` then runs the approved plan **unattended**: code, code review,
  and security review per step (plus one acceptance + ux pass after all steps),
  deciding from a fixed rule set and stopping only on a hard halt, a resource
  cap, an all-blocking gap, an irreversible decision — or the **final gate**,
  where you review the whole run and approve the merge.
- **Released APIs are frozen.** Once `/vwf:verify` records a production release,
  breaking a released API contract is blocked like a security finding —
  reviewers loop it until fixed, and the only way out is a conscious
  major-version bump. If you want to move fast and break contracts, this will
  fight you.
- **Requires a testable project.** `execute` enforces non-negotiable TDD and a
  coverage gate. A project without a test runner won't fit the execute stage;
  missing coverage tooling is tolerated (the coder reports `coverage: n/a` and
  the gate decides). The verification harness (dev server, E2E suites, staging
  mode) is self-healing: `setup` detects and stamps what exists, and `plan`
  injects bootstrap steps for whatever a slice's gates need — so harness gaps
  surface at plan time with their fix attached, not as surprises at a gate.
- **Assumes a registry-described workspace.** `plan` and `execute` map each
  slice to a project in the architecture registry and read its code (submodules
  included). You model the codebase with `/vwf:architecture` first; it won't
  operate on an ad-hoc folder.
- **Structure and stacks are both menus.** `vwf` ships three topology templates
  (`repo` / `monorepo` / `multi-repo`) and `/vwf:architecture` presents stack
  templates per axis — you pick, and the choice plus its reason is recorded so
  it is never re-litigated. A multi-repo product picks a **linkage** too:
  `submodule` (recommended) or `siblings`, so a product whose repos are ordinary
  clones needs no restructuring to be onboarded.
- **Solo / small-team focus.** It is highly opinionated — one workflow, one set
  of conventions. Great for a solo dev or small team; not a configurable
  framework for a large org.

## The mental model

Each phase answers one question:

- **Product** answers *is this worth building, and what does "good" mean?* — the
  problem, the users, measurable goals, and the order to build in. Every flow in
  the blueprint must trace to a goal here.
- **Blueprint** answers *what should the whole product be?* — permanent,
  product-wide, organized by **flow** (the user/system journeys, grouped by the
  registry project that owns each journey and numbered in execution order —
  mobile-app flows live apart from website and console flows), with entities as
  the supporting data contracts. It is a **code-independent technical
  contract**: it pins every decision that has more than one reasonable answer
  *and* is true regardless of how the code is written — flows (each with
  acceptance criteria and a sequence diagram, carrying the screens and jobs they
  need), data models as JSON-Schema `schema.yaml` files, API surfaces as
  per-service OpenAPI contracts, relationships, concurrency, and UI/UX — so
  `plan` and `execute` never have to ask or assume. A whole-product coherence
  review walks every flow across the entities and contracts before coverage
  counts as complete. Reuse-vs-build, file placement, ordering, and library
  choices are `plan`'s job, not the blueprint's.
- **Plan** answers *what changes for this one slice, and in what order?* — a
  diff, not a re-blueprint, scoped to a single flow or entity. Unbuilt
  dependencies are not swallowed into the plan: each becomes **its own plan**,
  chained (`covers:`/`requires:`) and executed in order.
- **Execute** answers *is it built, correct, safe, and does it do what the
  blueprint promises?* — TDD, then code/security review, then E2E acceptance and
  rendered-UI conformance. When the run lands, it stamps each covered blueprint
  doc's `implementation:` state — the blueprint stays the source of truth, and
  it now knows what's built.
- **Verify & feedback** answer *does it hold in production, and what next?* —
  post-deploy checks against the same acceptance criteria, and a routed intake
  for what production teaches you. A clean production run offers to record a
  **release**, freezing each service's API contract — from then on, breaking a
  released API is blocked like a security finding unless you consciously cut a
  new major version.

Each command has its own cadence — `setup` once, `product` on every product
change, `plan` per build cycle — and the transitions chain from gate offers.
**Blue** nodes are commands you prompt; **gray dashed** nodes run without you
typing them (you only approve at their gates):

```

(`setup` **prints** the chain `product` → `architecture` → `design-system` →
`blueprint` and offers to start the first one; it runs none of them, because
each resolves its own mode and reports what it did. Blue marks who prompts them.
Fully internal machinery never appears in the flow: `/vwf:git-workflow` is
invoked by the other commands for every git action, `/vwf:docs-sync` closes
every run that changes reality (and is yours to run after ad-hoc work), the five
execute subagents and the reviewer subagents run inside their commands, and
`handoff`/`recall` are session utilities you reach for only when a session runs
long.)

`/vwf:setup` runs once per repo (re-run to reconcile the format), and hands you
the chain rather than walking it. From there on, **`/vwf:product` is the front
door for every product change** — adding, updating, or retiring features and
goals — with `architecture` following when the system's shape changes and
`design-system` when the visual language does. Any foundation change ends in a
`/vwf:blueprint` sweep, which loops flow by flow (deriving the entities,
schemas, and API operations each flow stands on) until the **whole product** is
covered again — including a whole-product coherence review — and re-stamps that
coverage (`plan` refuses to run without it), then offers to plan the top slice.
Building is **one command per cycle**: `/vwf:plan <slice>` resolves the slice's
unbuilt dependencies into a **chain of small plans** (each behind its own gate,
executed in order — never one plan swallowing its dependencies), the last gate
offers *Approve & execute*, `execute` runs each plan unattended in a dedicated
worktree up to one final gate where you review the run and approve the merge —
stamping the covered blueprint docs' `implementation:` state as it lands — and
`archive` is offered once no gaps remain. After you deploy, `verify` checks the
environment (and, on a clean production pass, offers to freeze the released API
contracts) and `feedback` routes what production says back into the product.
When execution exposes a hole in the blueprint or plan, `vwf` captures it and
loops back to fix the source — never silently working around it.

## The documents it maintains

`vwf` keeps everything in version-controlled Markdown under `docs/`. The
blueprint is the desired state; the plans are the changes you apply to reach it.

```

Each flow doc holds one journey end to end — who triggers it, the steps across
entities and services, the screens and jobs it needs, and the acceptance
criteria that prove it. Each entity doc is the data contract under those flows
(`Used by:` links them), with its authoritative shape in `schema.yaml`. Flow and
entity docs carry an `implementation:` frontmatter stamp the pipeline maintains
— the blueprint always knows what's built. The **Project Registry** is its own
file, `registry.yaml`, which `blueprint` and `plan` parse to map a flow's
sections to the right project by `type`; `architecture.md` is the prose view of
the same facts and no command reads it.

The registry carries **no stack**. Which technology each project is built with
lives in `.config/vwf.yaml`, as a structured block naming the template you
picked plus its languages, frameworks and key dependencies. That split is not
bookkeeping: it means no blueprint-authoring or reviewing surface can see a
technology name, so a blueprint that mentions your database, cloud, or payment
vendor fails review by construction. Docs say "the datastore" and "the payment
provider", and stay true when you swap either.

## Structure

Structure is a **menu**, like stacks. `vwf` ships three topology templates and
`/vwf:setup` presents the one it detects for confirmation; the choice and its
reason land in `.config/vwf.yaml` and are never re-litigated.

| Topology     | What it is                                             | `docs/blueprint/` lives |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `repo`       | One codebase, deployed as a whole                      | the repo root           |
| `monorepo`   | One VCS repo, several independently-buildable projects | the repo root           |
| `multi-repo` | A group of repos coordinated by a **base** repo        | the base repo           |

The deciding question isn't project count — it's whether the product's code can
share **one dependency graph and one release cadence**. Yes → `monorepo`. No →
`multi-repo`. A Flutter app beside a TypeScript backend is the classic no: store
review can't sync with continuous deploy, and Dart can't share a dependency
graph with TypeScript.

A multi-repo product has a **base repo** holding the blueprint, the config and
the plan index — and no product code — plus one or more **members** holding the
code. How the members are wired is the `linkage:` choice:

**`linkage: submodule`** (recommended) — the members are git submodules, so one
`clone --recurse-submodules` reproduces the product at a known-good set of
commits, and the pointer commits record which member versions were ever
consistent together:

```text
my-product/           # base repo — vwf lives here
├── .gitmodules
├── docs/blueprint/   # the vwf bundle (one per product)
├── docs/plans/index.md
├── backend/          # submodule — a monorepo
│   ├── projects/     # api · worker · web · ops
│   └── packages/
│       └── common/   # the shared kernel
└── app/              # submodule — a single repo (Flutter)
```

**`linkage: siblings`** — the members are ordinary repos cloned next to the
base. Nothing wires them in git, so vwf does it: the base's `members:` list
names each one (with the git URL to clone it from), and each member carries
`.config/vwf-membership.yaml` pointing back. That back-link is load-bearing —
without it, running `/vwf:plan` from inside a member would find no config and
report a perfectly onboarded repo as un-onboarded.

```text
~/Projects/acme/
├── acme-product/     # base repo — docs only
│   ├── docs/blueprint/
│   └── .config/vwf.yaml     # members: [...]
├── acme-api/         # plain repo
│   └── .config/vwf-membership.yaml
└── acme-app/
    └── .config/vwf-membership.yaml
```

**Not every member has to be on your machine.** A twenty-repo product doesn't
fit on one laptop, and vwf detects what's present on every run rather than
recording it — presence is per-developer state, not a property of the product.
When a command needs a repo you don't have, it offers to clone it; decline and
it proceeds with that project excluded and **says which projects it couldn't
inspect**. `/vwf:execute` is the exception and stops, since it can't write code
into a repo you don't have.

**Where plans live:** a plan lives in the repo whose code it changes, and the
base repo keeps a thin `docs/plans/index.md`. In a `repo` or `monorepo` product
that's the one checkout, so the rule costs nothing.

Existing repos whose layout differs from their topology's suggested grouping get
a **written recommendation** from `/vwf:setup` — never a move. setup writes and
moves documentation only; every source-layout change, in-repo or across a repo
boundary, is named in the report with its target layout and left to you.
Recording a decline under `enforcement:` stops the proposal recurring, not the
finding: `/vwf:doctor` keeps reporting it. Adding or removing a repo later is
incremental, and removing one **archives** its blueprint docs rather than
deleting them.

### Stack templates

The stack is **not** enforced — and **vwf itself ships no stack templates at
all**. It defines the axes, the `role` vocabulary and the template shape; every
actual option lives in a **stack plugin**, under whatever layout that plugin
keeps — vwf never reads one by path, only through two fixed adapter skill names.
`/vwf:architecture` presents the union across your installed plugins as a menu —
one round per project. The menu is the **whole** answer: there is no *other
(describe)* option, so an axis nothing on it fits is never recorded as a
free-text pin (see below). Each project carries exactly one role, so it picks
exactly one project template and there is nothing to merge. Install no stack
plugin and the menu is empty — since `config_format` **16** that is a
postponement rather than a dead end: vwf names the three ways forward (install
the plugin that has one, write it, or **defer the axis** as `unresolved`) rather
than coming back quietly short.

A stack is composed from **six independent axes** — you answer each one, and
they never merge because they never overlap. `project` and `repo` take a single
template; `backing` and `deploy` take a **list**, one entry per capability and
one per delivery mechanism (`deploy_template` became a list in `config_format`
**16**, because a project routinely publishes to a package registry *and* ships
a container image):

| Axis        | Scope       | Takes                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **project** | per project | one template, filtered by the platforms the project declares — see below                   |
| **backing** | per project | a list — one entry per capability the project talks to (datastore, identity, telemetry, …) |
| **deploy**  | per project | a list — one entry per delivery mechanism the project ships through                        |
| **repo**    | per repo    | one template describing the checkout — its package manager and workspace layout            |
| **design**  | per project | one design tool — the slug *is* the config value                                           |
| **cicd**    | per project | one CI system — the slug *is* the config value                                             |

**No slug appears in that table on purpose.** The roster is not vwf's to state:
the menu is the union of what your **installed** stack plugins declare, so it
changes with what you install, and `/vwf:architecture` is what enumerates it for
your repo. Today [stackgen](./stackgen.md) is the only stack plugin, and it
carries all six axes — the general-purpose set, the managed backing and deploy
services of each cloud it packs, and a generator for whatever no pack covers.

Since `config_format` **13** every axis but `repo` is pinned **per project**, so
a product can host its site on Cloudflare, its API on GCP and its worker
somewhere else again — and design its app in one tool while its website is
designed in another. On the `design` and `cicd` axes the slug **is** the config
value, so the menu pick and the config key are one value rather than two that
can disagree. Only `repo` stays per repo; it describes the checkout, not a
project.

**An axis can also be left unanswered.** Since `config_format` **16** any of the
six may read `unresolved` — deferred, not decided — which is the line between
*defining* a product and *building* one. `/vwf:product`, `/vwf:architecture`,
`/vwf:blueprint`, `/vwf:design-system` and every other doc surface run to
completion with no stack chosen at all; `/vwf:doctor` reports the deferral as a
**degradation** every run and its stack-dependent checks report
`not checked — no stack resolved`; and `/vwf:plan` and `/vwf:execute` **halt**,
naming the axis and pointing at `/vwf:architecture`, because both size their
work against the pinned templates' conventions and an unresolved axis has none.
`unresolved` is not `template: custom` returning: `custom` asserted a stack that
did not exist and let the pipeline run on silently, while `unresolved` says out
loud that nobody has chosen — which is exactly why plan and execute refuse. `[]`
on the two list axes is its opposite: a decision that this project ships through
nothing, or talks to no backing service.

**Project-axis templates.** A template declares **which platforms it serves**,
and that list is what the menu filters on. One template routinely covers
several: an app framework can build four surfaces from one codebase, and a
full-stack template serves an API and its own UI — what the retired `fullstack`
role meant. **Your pin must cover every platform your project declares**, which
`/vwf:doctor` checks. Which templates exist, and what each is made of, is the
stack plugin's answer — [stackgen](./stackgen.md) states the set it ships.

**Templates ship in a stack plugin, never in vwf.** vwf has no `stacks/` tree at
all: it owns the six axes, the platform vocabulary a template declares against,
and the two adapter skill names it reaches a plugin through. So a product gets
whichever menu its installed plugins add up to, and one that installs nothing
sees an empty one.

**Why the split matters.** The same Hono + Effect service runs against Firebase
or Postgres, on Cloud Run or any container host. Before format 19 all three were
welded into one document, so picking `service` because you wanted Hono silently
also bought you Firestore, Firebase Auth, Temporal and Cloud Run — none of it
declared. Now a project template names no vendor and a backing template names no
framework — and a backing template is now one capability rather than a vendor
bundle, so `postgres` + `oidc` + `otel-lgtm` + `temporal`, each a stackgen
bundle, is a completely vendor-free path through vwf.

An operator back-office is `platforms: [service, webapp]` plus the
`operator-rbac` capability, and picks whichever project template serves both of
those platforms at once. A project shipping through a store rather than to a
deploy target (`mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`, `auto`) records `[]` on the deploy
axis, as does an `iac` project — it *is* the deploy path. A `cli` project pins
one, because a package registry is its target; **which** template that is is the
stack plugin's answer, and vwf names no slug on this axis or any other.

**`iac` is the one platform vwf constrains structurally.** A project declaring
`iac` must live in **its own repo** — independent, or a member of the product's
base repo — under every topology, monorepo included. Blast radius, credentials,
lifecycle and cadence all differ in kind from application code, and one repo
cannot separate them. `/vwf:doctor` raises a violation as a **blocking** finding
and `/vwf:setup` writes the extraction up as a recommendation — it moves
nothing. Recording the decline under `enforcement:` drops the finding to a
warning reported every run, and neither `setup` nor `execute` halts on it after
that. Nothing else about repo shape is enforced.

A template reaches vwf as a **payload**, never as a file: its stack facts
(**languages**, **frameworks**, **dependencies**, plus the optional languages a
template admits — Flutter's Kotlin and Swift) and its **conventions** prose,
carrying the layout, testing and deployment rules. How a stack plugin stores
that template is its own business. Picking one fills those facts into
`.config/vwf.yaml`; you can then customize any of them.

Only the axes land in the config — the conventions prose stays with the plugin,
and `/vwf:plan` and `/vwf:execute` fetch it when they run: deduped by template
slug, once per run, before any work starts. That is what they size steps and
write code against, so a fetch that fails halts rather than degrading — code
written to conventions nobody read is indistinguishable from code written to
conventions that said nothing. The prose reaches `docs/plans/` and your source,
and never `docs/blueprint/`: it names technology, which is exactly what a
blueprint doc may not.

**vwf names no language, but the menu is closed.** A language token is whatever
a template declares, and the facts the tooling acts on — which LSP server covers
it, which manifest identifies it, which mise tool installs it — come from the
**language plugin** that owns it. vwf holds no table of its own; the union of
what the installed plugins declare **is** the vocabulary. `/vwf:doctor` reads
the block back and checks the repo agrees: an LSP server and toolchain per
declared language, every framework and dependency present in the project's
manifest, the repo's package manager and tooling, harness task names, health
paths. It reports drift in both directions, including a framework doing obvious
structural work that your config never mentions.

A language no installed plugin claims is reported as *unknown*, and since
`config_format` **14** that is a **blocking** finding: `/vwf:setup` and
`/vwf:execute` both halt on it. Since **16** the severity follows the pin: while
the project's `template` reads `unresolved` an unclaimed token is only a
**degradation** — the plugin that would claim it is exactly what has not been
chosen yet — and such a project legally records `languages: []`. The moment the
axis is pinned, unknown is blocking again. There is likewise no *other
(describe)* option and no `template: custom` — an axis nothing on the menu fits
has three ways forward, none of them a free-text pin. vwf is an opinionated
workflow that plans against a template's conventions, builds against its harness
and gates a UI slice on its UX contract; a stack no plugin defines supplies none
of those, so a run against it would lose every guarantee *while reporting itself
healthy*. Many stacks are supported — every one of them defined by a plugin.

The one second door is the **materialized escape**: a materializing adapter (the
[`stackgen`](./stackgen.md) plugin) can land a template directly in the repo's
committed `.claude/` tree through consent-gated, reviewer-gated generation, and
a language whose pin carries that template's emitted `language_facts` (LSP
provision, mise tool, manifest) is *known* — doctor verifies against the facts
instead of a language plugin. A token with neither stays blocking; nothing about
the escape re-opens free text.

Adding a stack option means adding a template file **to a plugin**, never to
vwf. One entry per type today is a starting point, not a default.

Two placement rules ride along with the shape — seeded into each repo's
`conventions.md` and enforced by the execute reviewers:

1. **All shared schemas live in `packages/common`** — Effect Schemas, one export
   subpath per entity; no other project defines a shared data schema.
2. **All third-party integrations go via `packages/common`** — Firebase and
   every other external service are wrapped once as Effect layers; no other
   project imports a third-party SDK directly (client-side sign-in is the one
   exception).

They are joined by the **engineering baseline** — 16 centralized technical rules
seeded into `conventions.md#baseline` on the blueprint's first touch and
followed by default everywhere; only exceptions are documented. The set:
optimistic **write versioning** on every mutating write (entity docs stop
re-deciding concurrency — the default is the contract), atomic multi-document
writes, server-authoritative UTC timestamps, soft-delete by default, strict
**boundary validation** (malformed input/output rejected, never coerced — the
one rule that can never be waived product-wide), business/technical code
separation with backing services as attached resources (injected config only),
idempotency keys on every mutating operation, one error envelope, cursor
pagination, retry-only-idempotent with backoff + jitter, tolerant-reader event
consumers, **stateless processes** (every service/worker safe at N replicas),
**graceful shutdown** (acknowledged work never lost to a termination),
structured logs with no PII (logs/traces/metrics through one vendor-neutral
telemetry pipeline), integer minor units for money, and **expand → migrate →
contract** for non-additive stored-schema changes (expand and contract never
share a release, so every release stays compatible with the one before it). A
deviation lives in **two places, always**: stated on the doc it applies to and
waived under `enforcement.rules` (`baseline/<rule>[/<unit>]`) — the blueprint
reviewers flag either half missing, and the execute reviewers enforce the rules
against the code itself.

Beside the baseline sits the **principles catalog** (`assets/principles/` —
thirteen entries: KISS, YAGNI, DRY and its limits, the five SOLID principles,
information hiding, design by contract, idempotency, explicit error semantics,
least privilege). The baseline is enforced contract; the catalog is the
**judgment** applied where the baseline is silent. Every entry has the same
fixed shape — definition, smells, how a reviewer verifies it, application
patterns, and **when not to apply it**, the last section being the
anti-rubber-stamp defense: a principle recited without its limits is a slogan.
Reviewers may cite an entry to make a judgment-call finding contestable rather
than taste, and the catalog is what the `stackgen` plugin instantiates when it
generates stack skills for a technology no curated pack covers.

Alongside it sits the **delivery-pipeline contract**
(`conventions.md#pipeline`): three canonical environments — `development` (the
developer's machine, any branch, never deployed), `staging` (testers only) and
`production` (customers) — with `dev`/`test`/`prod`-style synonyms treated as
drift. Each deployed environment releases from **exactly one branch**; which
branch is the product's to choose and record there, `develop` and `main` being
the default pair. A deploy is **deliberate** — an explicit act naming one
project and one environment, never a side effect of a branch push, and
re-validated by the pipeline rather than trusted from its trigger — the pipeline
**proves the commit is reachable** from that environment's branch, and **no
deploy step runs before the released project's and its dependents' tests pass in
the same run**. A staging deploy is never a release; production releases are
recorded only by `/vwf:verify`. Three further rules bind the release itself: a
flow whose declared peak rate meets the load threshold gets a staging load run
before its first production release, every production deploy states the release
it rolls back to (or records that it is irreversible), and every release-capable
run audits the lockfile — a known-critical advisory fails it, waivable only per
advisory and with a date. The contract names no mechanism on purpose: the tag
grammar `<project>-<env>-v<semver>`, the trigger globs and the reachability
check are the recommended default, owned by the CI system pinned on the
project's `cicd` axis — [`stackgen`](./stackgen.md)'s
`contracts/release-trigger.md` and its `ci-system` pack.

The **operator back-office** deserves a note. Since format 22 it is not its own
role: it is `platforms: [service, webapp]` plus the `operator-rbac` capability —
a single app serving both the operator API and an embedded UI, and the **sole
holder of admin capabilities** (the public `service` exposes no admin routes).
The capability, not a type name, is what marks it.

The full stack docs ship inside each **stack plugin** under its own `stacks/`
tree — never in vwf — and drive what `/vwf:setup` and `/vwf:architecture`
record.

**Five are user-only** — `setup`, `verify`, `mockups`, `archive` and `recall`
carry `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the model never fires them on its
own; you decide when a migration, a post-deploy check, a re-render, a plan
retirement or a session resume happens. The rest stay model-invocable because
the workflow **delegates to them by name** — `recall` resumes a paused run
*through* `blueprint`/`plan`/`execute`, every skill commits *through*
`git-workflow`, `setup` runs `doctor` inside its own spine, and `feedback` and
`plan` route work into `product`/`architecture`/`design-system`/`blueprint`.
Marking one of those user-only would silently break the chain: the flag blocks
programmatic invocation, not just auto-triggering.

Model and reasoning effort are **tiered per surface**, not uniform. `opus` runs
where judgment decides the outcome or where nobody is watching — `product`,
`blueprint`, `plan`, and `execute` (the only unattended command), plus the
`blueprint-reviewer`, `blueprint-coherence-reviewer`, `execute-coder`,
code-review, security-review, and ux subagents. `sonnet` runs the remaining
commands and the writer/surveyor subagents; `haiku` runs the two purely
mechanical ones (`archive`, `recall`). Effort tracks the same logic — `high`
through most of the workflow, `medium`/`low` on mechanical surfaces. No
configuration can skip a gate: `pipeline.models` may re-tier a stage, but the
stage always runs and any downgrade is reported at that gate.

Under the hood each command is a **skill** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — Claude
Code's unified skills keep the `/vwf:<name>` invocation exactly as before (this
needs a recent Claude Code), and the model can also invoke them itself when the
conversation calls for one. One artifact serves both paths, which is why this
plugin ships no `commands/` directory.

### /vwf:init

`/vwf:init [--new | --existing] [target-dir]` shapes the **base repo** — the
layout everything else assumes. `/vwf:setup` sets up **vwf** in it. The two are
a pair and neither does the other's job: the config layout, the task vocabulary,
the gates, the ignore set and a licence belong to `init`; `docs/blueprint/`,
`.config/vwf.yaml` and the memory tree stay `setup`'s. On a repo that has
neither, run `init` first.

**It names no tool, and that is the design.** Every file it lays down comes from
a stackgen pack, fetched through the stack adapter by three fixed slugs — the
toolchain manager, the repo gates and the repo hygiene bundles, all three
*unconditional*, so a repo that has picked no stack still gets them. `init`
decides *when* the packs land, *what* you are asked, and how an existing tree is
reconciled against what they ship. With no stack-adapter plugin installed it
**halts** with the install command rather than printing an empty plan that reads
exactly like an already-shaped repo.

What a shaped repo has when it is done: a sectioned `.gitignore`, a lowercase
`readme.md`, every tool config under `.config/`, the toolchain manager's
five-file split and its tracked lockfile, a file-based task library grouped
`setup:*`, `code:*` and `p:<project>:*` over a shared helper library, pre-commit
with the full hook set and conventional commits wired for release notes, the
security and dependency gates configured, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, a
Renovate config, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates under `.github/`, an ignore
file for the code-intelligence graph, and composed editor settings and extension
recommendations. Three of its contents follow the answers rather than the shape:
a secrets provider where you named one — answer *none — decide later* and the
packs' slot simply stays unfilled and announces itself — a `SECURITY.md` unless
you declined the security contact, and a `LICENSE` unless you answered *none*.

**The editor files are composed, not shipped.** No pack writes one whole,
because two packs with an opinion about the same file is a lost update; each
contributes a small per-pack fragment and `init` merges them — deep-merging the
settings, unioning the file-nesting children per parent and the recommendation
list — into one marked block placed **first** in each file. Anything you write
after that block is yours: it wins on a conflict, and a second run leaves it
byte-for-byte. `init` never names the editor; the fragment convention names the
target, and a pack task is what installs the recommended extensions into a
per-repo profile.

**Project ids are slugged**, and the repo's own name with them. The resolved id
— from the registry, a sub-directory, or the repo's name — is lowercased, runs
outside the slug alphabet collapse to a single `-`, and the ends are trimmed, so
`My.App` becomes `my-app`. That is not cosmetic: the task runner reads a
per-project group's directory name as the task's *last* segment and strips what
looks like a file extension from it, so an id carrying a dot silently loses
everything after it. The same slug fills four surfaces — the task groups, the
bootstrap aggregator's member flags, the `setup-<id>` aliases, and `REPO_NAME`,
the repo-level environment key your own shell aliases can read. `REPO_NAME` is
written **literally** and never derived from the directory: a linked worktree's
config root is named for the branch.

**Mode resolves from what is on disk**, unless `--new` or `--existing` says
otherwise: no `.config/` directory *and* no task-library directory means
**new**; anything else means **existing**. The signal is deliberately narrow — a
repo with source, a readme and a licence but no configuration layout has never
been shaped, and nothing in the new pipeline touches source.

**Five questions, each one round**, asked *before* the plan so one yes covers
all of it. Two on a new repo only — the repo name (proposed from the directory)
and a one-line brief, which may be empty. Three on any repo — which provider
holds this repo's secrets (the adapter's own menu, filtered to capability
providers, plus *none — decide later*), the licence (MIT, Apache-2.0 or none),
and a security-contact URL (defaulted to the origin's advisories page; declining
writes no security file, since one naming a channel nobody watches is worse than
none).

**On an existing repo it surveys, plans, and applies on one consent.** The
survey walks ten checks — root files against the allowlist, the readme's casing,
task names against the pack's *legacy-name table*, task shebangs, the helper
library's shape, missing files, ignore sections and hook fragments, commit
types, per-project task groups, and the gate-config positions the packs ship
marked for it to fill. Pass 1 has one case worth knowing: where a gate pack
declares both a config under `.config/` and a two-line stand-in of the same name
at the root — the stand-in existing because that tool's config discovery is
root-only — your **real** config moves into `.config/` and the stand-in takes
its place, with the plan saying the settings survive the move. The two are told
apart by content, never by name. What comes back is **one plan**, in six counted
sections: moves, creates, renames, appends, merges — all applied on a single yes
— and `Rewrites (flagged, not applied)`, which is applied by nothing. A task
file whose shebang names a shell other than bash goes there, listed with the
shell-specific syntax it uses, and is **never** rewritten: auto-translating a
shell script is how a working task becomes a subtly broken one, so it lands in
the report's `Deferred` section for you to rewrite deliberately. It never asks
per file, never writes before the yes, never touches application code, and never
writes a language manifest, a lockfile or a CI workflow.

**Your readme is moved, never rewritten.** `README.md` → `readme.md` is a move
like any other in the plan — content untouched, applied with `git mv` so the
history follows the file. A repo already carrying `readme.md` needs nothing, and
one carrying both names is reported as a conflict for you rather than resolved
here. `init` writes a stub only where there is no readme at all, and the stub is
exactly two lines: the H1 and the one-line brief, or the H1 alone when the brief
is empty.

**It ends with a git pass, and that pass is consent-gated.** Everything above it
lands on disk; a repo shaped and left dirty is a repo whose next command — a
commit, a worktree, a merge — meets a working tree it did not expect. So `init`
stages **exactly what this run wrote** (never `git add -A`, so untracked work of
your own is not swept into a commit about the repo's shape) and asks **one
question with three answers**, showing the file count and the branch first:
*commit*, *commit and push*, or *leave it*. Push is a second decision inside one
question, never an assumed consequence of committing. The message is fixed and
uses the `ops:` type the commit gate this run just installed will read it
against. History is never rewritten, nothing is force-pushed, and no
verification-skipping flag is ever passed.

**The branch model, on a brand-new repo: `develop` first, `main` from the first
commit.** A repository with no commit has an unborn HEAD, so there is nothing
for a second branch to point at — and the mechanism happens to match the model,
since work flows from a feature branch or a worktree into `develop` and from
`develop` into `main`. On an existing repo `init` creates whichever of the two
is missing, from the one that is there. Both always end up present, because the
repo's own merge tasks refuse a destination branch that does not exist locally.
Then it asks **which branch the remote should default to**, with `develop`
preselected, and runs a pack task for it — `setup:default-branch` — reporting
only what that task reported, since whether it set the default or printed a
command for you depends on what it found. `init` names no forge and inspects
none.

On an existing repo one commit goes **first and alone**: the pre-commit
configuration and the files it reads. A configuration file that is
modified-but-unstaged aborts every commit, including the one that would have
staged it, so a run that touched it has to close that file before it can commit
anything else. On a new repo no such ordering is needed — the first commit
precedes hook wiring by construction, which is also why the shipped
protected-branch hook ships unchanged and never sees it.

**Every run ends with the same report** — files written, files moved, tasks
renamed, sections appended, fragments merged, and anything deferred with the
thing that would unlock it, then a **git** section: branches created, the
commit's short hash, what was pushed, and the forge task's own words verbatim.
An empty section prints as `none`. Then two next-step lines, always both and
neither of them run: `/vwf:readme` to fill the readme the stub only opens, and
`/vwf:setup` to bring the repo into vwf's format.

**When to run it again.** `init` is not a one-time bootstrap — it is what keeps
a repo's *shape* in step with what the packs ship and with what the repo has
since learned about itself, and drift there is silent until the day a task is
missing or a gate reads a config nobody filled. Run it **after the registry
exists** (`/vwf:architecture` and `/vwf:setup` give the project ids their real
source, which makes the commit gate's scope list fillable and may move a task
group), **after a pack version moves**, **on a fresh clone that reports drift**,
and **whenever `/vwf:doctor` says so**. Doctor's repo-shape check is what
notices between runs: the pack versions the adapter's lockfile recorded against
what it ships now, each registry id against its task group, commit scope and
alias, both branches, and the repo-name key. Every one of those is `drift` and
none is blocking — a repo behind its baseline is out of date, not broken — and
all of them share the one remedy, printed once. A run that finds nothing costs
one empty plan and says the repo is shaped, which is the answer rather than a
wasted run.

A second run on a shaped repo produces an **empty plan** and says so, **for the
same id source**. The one legitimate exception is a run whose ids now come from
a registry the repo did not have before: those rows read *id source changed*,
naming both sources, and are never reported as a pack having moved. A declined
write is a recorded deferral, never a halt — re-run `/vwf:init` whenever.

### /vwf:setup

Run this to **onboard a repo** — new or existing — into vwf's format, and re-run
it after upgrading vwf to bring the tree back to the current format.

**Step 0 begins with a shape check, before the mode fork.** A repo is *shaped*
when the stack adapter's lockfile records all three unconditional slugs. Any of
them missing and setup says what is absent and offers [`/vwf:init`](#vwfinit),
which is what lays them down — that seam is why `init` is model-invocable as
well as slash-invocable. Declining is a recorded deferral, not a halt: the repo
shape and the vwf format are two different things, and a repo can be onboarded
into one without the other. Setup itself never materializes a bundle any more.

**Step 0 resolves one of three entry paths**, once, from what is on disk, and
nothing after it re-derives the mode:

| `.config/vwf.yaml`                                       | Mode                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| absent, and no legacy `docs/blueprint/.vwf.yml`          | `onboard` — forking on evidence between a blank repo and one with code |
| parseable, either stamp behind — or only the legacy file | `migrate`                                                              |
| parseable, both stamps current                           | `current` — report the stamps, print the chain, exit                   |
| present but **unparseable**                              | halt, with the parse error and two remedies                            |

An unparseable config is never onboarded over: it still records decisions
nothing else does, so overwriting it would discard them silently. There is **no
progress key and no resume state** — re-running *is* the resume mechanism, since
a conforming repo resolves to `current` and a half-finished onboard re-detects
and produces a smaller plan.

**`migrate` is state-based, not a ladder.** It reconciles the tree against the
current format's own sources — the doc templates, the conformance bundle, the
authoring bars, the config doctrine — rather than replaying per-version steps,
resolving retired spellings through a **lineage table** and confirming by MCQ
any old spelling that fans out to more than one current one. The stamps are
drift detectors; nothing selects a migration by them, so there is no support
window.

Whichever path runs, it detects your topology (repo, monorepo, or multi-repo +
linkage; project roles and platforms; stacks) and confirms it with you via MCQ,
then produces a **dry-run plan** of every doc to scaffold or reconcile. On a
new/empty repo it applies the workspace structure as the default and elicits
each project's stack from the [template menu](#stack-templates) — a platform no
installed plugin has a template for leaves that axis unrecorded for
`/vwf:architecture` to settle rather than halting the run. `setup` never writes
`unresolved` itself; that value only ever comes from an `/vwf:architecture` run
that offered the axis. It also writes the product's **one** `mempalace.yaml`, at
the repo root — one wing, the seven rooms vwf's memory protocol uses, and a
secret denylist behind `.gitignore` — mining the whole tree including
submodules, and consolidating away any config it finds in `.config/` or a
submodule root (mining reads the config only from the directory it is pointed
at, so a stray one is silently inert rather than merely wrong). Nothing is
written until you approve; it works in a worktree, never deletes, and **never
moves a source file** — a layout that differs from its topology's grouping, and
an `iac` project sitting in another project's repo, both end the run as written
recommendations rather than as moves. It merges a vwf section into your
`CLAUDE.md`, writes a `.graphifyignore` at the repo root (the vwf-standard
excludes, plus any committed-but-not-code trees it detects — see
[Code intelligence](#code-intelligence)), bootstraps `environment.md` from the
repo's existing env-var and secret usage (names only), detects the repo's
verification-harness capabilities (dev server, E2E, staging mode), and stamps
the **vwf config** at `.config/vwf.yaml` — the blueprint and config format
versions, harness inventory, enforcement opt-outs, and per-project nuances (a
coverage-target override, a non-conventional health path) — so a later run
detects drift, and every command knows how vwf operates in this repo (pipeline
knobs, verify environments, the mempalace wing).

**The ordering of the shared spine is the point:** validate the bundle, *then*
write the config, *then* run `/vwf:doctor` against it — a stamp written before
validation describes a tree nothing checked. A **blocking** doctor finding halts
the run *and reverts the stamp*, so no stamped-but-unrunnable artifact survives;
a declined graph build and a recorded `iac` decline are the two exceptions,
noted as degradations rather than halts. Past the approval gate and commit,
setup offers the graph build (it is the only command that builds one) and then
**prints the chain** — `product` → `architecture` → `design-system` →
`blueprint`, with `readme` optional — offering to start the first. It runs none
of them.

Every workflow command also runs a quick format check against that stamp and
nudges you to re-run `/vwf:setup` when a repo falls behind — so a single
user-level vwf upgrade reaches each repo on next use. A stamped config with no
registry yet is a **legal early state**, not drift: doctor reports it as "early
— next `/vwf:product`, then `/vwf:architecture`" and the format check stays
silent.

### /vwf:product

The **Phase −1** foundation — run it before `architecture`. It elicits, PM
style, what no other doc pins down: the **problem** (and why now), the **target
users**, **goals with measurable metrics** (each under a stable anchor), the
**slice priority** (what to build next and why), non-goals, and the riskiest
assumptions — each assumption carrying a validation method from a closed
vocabulary with a status and evidence, and the first goal a `Re-evaluate if:`
kill criterion. A stateless `product-reviewer` subagent gates the doc — an
unmeasurable metric or a solution-shaped problem statement is a gap, not a pass.

This is what gives the rest of the workflow product teeth: `blueprint` halts
without `product.md`, every flow must declare which goal it **serves** (the
reviewer rejects a flow no goal justifies; entities trace to goals through the
flows that use them), and `/vwf:feedback` logs metric readings against it. It's
not a one-time doc — re-run it on **every product change**: adding, updating, or
retiring a feature/goal, a pivot, or a re-rank (update mode asks only about the
delta). Retired goals reconcile their inbound links, never dangle.

### /vwf:architecture

Run this **after `product`**. It elicits your system's shape — projects, their
types, how they interconnect, where they deploy — records each project's stack
by presenting the [stack templates](#stack-templates) for its type as a menu
(one round per project, and the menu is the whole vocabulary — nothing fitting
leaves three ways forward, none of them a free-text pin; the answer lands as a
structured block in `.config/vwf.yaml`), walks the **product-foundations
checklist** (see [vwf skills](#vwf-skills) — one accept/adapt/skip question per
elective foundation and accept/adapt/defer per core one, recorded as
cross-cutting tokens), and writes **both** `docs/blueprint/registry.yaml` — the
machine-readable registry every other command depends on — and
`docs/blueprint/architecture.md`, its prose view with a system-shape mermaid
diagram kept in sync with it. Re-run it any time the topology changes; it asks
only about genuine deltas, never re-eliciting what's confirmed.

**With no registry yet but a `product.md` in place, it derives rather than
interviews.** The structural questions — which surfaces exist, which projects
carry them, each project's role, the topology and repo placement — are read out
of the contract you already wrote and approved, each proposal carrying the
sentence from `product.md` it rests on, and corrected by MCQ one decision per
round. Anything the product contract underdetermines falls back to the same
interview as before, and a screen platform is never assumed — it makes the
design system mandatory, so each one is confirmed explicitly. With no
`product.md` either, it recommends `/vwf:product` first and offers the interview
as the fallback.

This is the one doc that *does* name technologies and infrastructure — the
blueprint deliberately doesn't.

### /vwf:design-system

A second foundation, **mandatory once the registry has a UI project** (some
project declares a **screen platform**) — and **import-only**: the design tool
owns design-system authoring. You pick or build the design system in the tool
the project pins on its `design` axis (for example Claude Design, whose stock
systems are strong; visual language is judged on a canvas, not as hex values in
chat); the command imports it through the design adapter:

```text
/vwf:design-system                  # resolve: pin → pick from your design systems
/vwf:design-system <ds-id>          # import this design system
```

It reads the chosen design system **as data**, distills it into
`docs/blueprint/design-system.md` — the **offline contract** the reviewers, the
execute ux gate, and the coder consume without network or design-tool auth —
elicits only what a canvas never decides (the accessibility conformance target;
the **Terminal UX** section when a project declares platform `cli`), runs the
**reviewer subagent** gate until `NO GAPS`, and pins `design.design_system_id`
in `.config/vwf.yaml` (**universal**: one per product). Like the blueprint, the
doc stays code-independent: token *values* and *scales*, never the component
library, CSS framework, or design file. Every flow's Screens reference it;
`blueprint` halts on a flow with screens until it exists.

**Drift is one-way.** The canvas is the source; the doc is its distillation.
Change the design system in the design tool and re-run the import — the doc is
never published back. With no design tool pinned for the project, or its pack
not yet materialized, the command halts naming the fix.

**One offline path, and only one.** A registry declaring **no** screen platform
at all — a `cli`- or `plugin`-only product — takes the **text-only path**: the
adapter preflight is skipped (it exists for screens, and there are none) and the
doc, starting with **Terminal UX**, is elicited directly. This is never a
fallback for a missing adapter on a product that *does* have screens; that still
halts.

### /vwf:blueprint

Maintain the desired end state of the **whole product**. A run is a **sweep**:
it derives a coverage worklist (every product goal served by a flow, every flow
reviewed, every entity/schema/API operation a flow references authored and
reviewed, every registry surface represented, every UI project carrying its
**mandatory standard flows** — see below) and works through it **flow by flow**
until whole-product coverage holds and a **whole-product coherence review**
passes — then stamps `blueprint.coverage: complete` in `.config/vwf.yaml`.
`plan` refuses to run until that stamp is complete, so a half-blueprinted
product can't leak gaps into code. Stopping early is fine — the stamp records
what remains, and the next run picks it up.

```text
/vwf:blueprint                # sweep from the top of the worklist
/vwf:blueprint place-order    # start the sweep at one flow (or entity)
```

**Standard flows.** UI projects carry a canonical flow vocabulary with exact
slugs — `splash`, `signin`, `home`, `onboarding`, `settings`, `notifications`,
`profile`, `delete-account`, `recover-account` — with per-role mandates: a
project on a device platform (`mobile`/`tablet`/`desktop`/`auto`) must have
`splash` and `home`; one on a browser platform (`site`/`webapp`) must have
`home` (`splash` optional). A project with no screen platform — `cli`-only or
`plugin`-only — is exempt: the standard slugs are screen journeys a terminal
tool or an extension has no equivalent for. A project whose registry entry
carries an **Auth & identity capability** must additionally have `signin` — and
with it `profile`, `delete-account`, and `recover-account` (an account you can
sign into can be viewed, recovered, and deleted). A missing mandatory standard
flow is a coverage hole like any other — waivable per flow under
`enforcement.rules` in `.config/vwf.yaml`, with a reason, never re-asked. The
slugs are exact: a `login` or `account` flow whose journey matches is proposed
for a consent-gated rename (links, catalogs, and canvas join keys move
together), never renamed silently.

Flows live **grouped by the registry project that owns the journey**, and a flow
folder holds two kinds of file: **`index.md`** — the platform-agnostic contract
(purpose, trigger, steps, diagram, jobs, acceptance; **no screens**) — plus one
**`<platform>.md`** per platform that implements the journey, carrying only that
platform's screens. A non-UI flow is `index.md` alone. Because the platform is
the *filename*, the flows tree and the design-brief tree have the **same shape
and the same names**.

**Plugin projects are blueprinted too, as of format 23.** Every other `system`
platform (`packages`, `iac`, `misc`, `cicd`) is registered but exempt from
blueprint coverage; **`plugin` and `cli`** are the two carve-outs. `cli` is
excepted because since vwf 19.1.0 it belongs to the `system` list as well as the
`frontend` one, and a tool's coverage must not turn on which role its project
carries — the same CLI would otherwise be covered or exempt depending on how it
was typed.

A `plugin` project's flows are its **invocable** extension points — one per
registration something can *trigger* (a command, an invocable skill, a hook). A
**subagent** is a step of the flow that dispatches it and **auto-applying
doctrine** is a Reference on the flows it governs: neither has a trigger or an
outcome of its own, so neither is a flow. Narrowed in 19.2.0 from *one flow per
skill, agent or hook*, which measured at 102 flows on a repo shipping fifteen
plugins from one project — a sweep nobody completes.

**Numbers are designated, not invented.** One number line per project:

```text
010 splash · 020 signin · 030 recover-account · 040 onboarding
100 home          ← the anchor: every UI project, always
110 … 890         ← the product's own journeys, gap-numbered by 10
910 profile · 920 settings · 930 notifications · 940 delete-account
```

So `home` is `100` in every product you ever blueprint, and its screens are
always coded `100a`, `100b`, … Deviating takes a waiver, like any other enforced
rule.

**Seven platforms, one vocabulary** — `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop` (a natively
installed app), `site` (a browser-delivered content surface), `webapp` (the
browser-delivered application), `auto` (in-car), and `cli` (a shipped
command-line or TUI tool). The names are form factors, not vendors: `mobile`
already hides iOS/Android, so **`auto` covers CarPlay and Android Auto
together**, with their template differences recorded as deviations inside
`auto.md`. `cli` is the one platform with **no screens**: it takes no platform
file and never reaches the design canvas, mockups, or the scratchpad — what it
requires instead is the design system's **Terminal UX** section. An in-car
journey is therefore a *platform file of the same flow* — `100-home/auto.md`,
same number, same steps, its own screens — not a separate subset flow. Which
platforms a flow implements is elicited per flow (signing in while driving makes
no sense) and listed in the contract's Platforms table.

Per flow, `blueprint` elicits the journey with you under the
**`blueprint-authoring`** doctrine — trigger and actors, the ordered steps,
consistency and failure handling, the screens and jobs the flow needs (each
screen down to its **components and their rules**: what it displays, when a
button is clickable, what content is product-decided), and its acceptance
criteria — then derives what the flow stands on: each referenced entity
(`entities/<entity>/index.md` + its `schema.yaml` data model), the API
operations it names (per-service OpenAPI contracts under `apis/`), the flow
catalog, and the product-wide ER diagram. Screens point at the design system;
`conventions.md` picks up any cross-cutting decision raised.

**You see every screen before you approve it.** A flow pass that authored or
changed Screens **gates on a render & review**: the pass renders that flow's
screens as static HTML mockups — the happy path *and* every pinned sad path
(error and empty states are mandatory pins per screen) — into the repo's
gitignored `docs/scratchpad/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>/` tree (**never
pushed to the design tool**), you open them in your browser, and your remarks
route straight back into the Screens contract before the pass closes. Prefer the
canvas to *design* the screens instead? The pass can defer design-first to
[`/vwf:screens`](#vwfscreens) — brief out, canvas designs, import folds back.
You can also explicitly skip — the skip is recorded honestly as
`screens/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>` in `blueprint.remaining`, which keeps coverage
`partial` like any other hole.

Complicated contracts are **drawn, not just tabled**: every flow carries a
mermaid sequence diagram (failure branch included), an entity lifecycle with
three or more states carries a state diagram beside its transition table,
`entities/index.md` carries the product-wide ER diagram, and `architecture.md` a
system-shape flowchart kept in sync with the registry. Diagrams are views of the
authoritative tables — the reviewers flag one that adds, contradicts, or goes
missing.

A fresh **reviewer subagent** checks each written doc against its completeness
checklist (flow or entity mode), plus a **code-independence guardrail** that
flags any file/class/library/CSS leakage or vendor name, and returns `NO GAPS`
or a numbered list — gaps loop back to you for the specific open decisions until
the doc passes.

It also enforces **density**, which is the only bar that asks for *less*. A
completeness checklist can only ever demand more text, so left alone it is a
ratchet: docs grow until someone notices. Each doc type has a line budget and a
set of anti-patterns — rationale, revision history ("X was renamed to Y" — git
records that), restating what a link already says, prose where a table was
meant, sentence-length diagram labels, Open Questions used as a parking lot —
and a doc that is long without deciding more fails review exactly as a thin one
does. The test for any line is whether `plan` or `execute` would do something
different without it. Contract is never cut to hit a budget: acceptance
criteria, failure paths, lifecycle transitions, invariants, and authorization
rows stay at any length.

Docs that are already over budget don't wait for someone to notice. The coverage
survey counts lines like any other condition, and each over-budget doc becomes a
worklist entry the sweep clears by dispatching a **condenser** subagent — a
rewrite that cuts commentary and carries every decision through unchanged.
Because condensation *decides* nothing, it needs no elicitation: the sweep works
the queue unattended, and the only things that reach you are the contract holes
a cut exposes (a guard that lived only in a diagram label, say). A doc whose
every remaining line is load-bearing is reported as honestly over budget and
clears — it never holds the coverage stamp hostage. When the worklist empties, a
**coherence reviewer** walks every flow end-to-end across entities, schemas, and
API contracts — the cross-doc gaps per-doc review can't see (a step whose state
change no lifecycle allows, data no schema holds, an operation no contract
defines, a breaking change to a released API) — and coverage stamps complete
only after it returns clean. The blueprint is permanent and product-wide; it is
never feature-scoped. Renaming or deleting a flow or entity triggers an
inbound-link reconcile, so no other doc is left pointing at a doc that moved.

### /vwf:mockups

The **batch re-render / regeneration tool** — blueprint flow passes render and
review each flow's screens in-pass, so you reach for this to re-render
everything after a design-system change, refresh a repo blueprinted before
in-pass rendering existed, or redo one flow post-hoc. Never a gate for `plan`.
It renders each flow's Screens contract as **self-contained static HTML
mockups** (one page per screen plus each pinned state variant, styled from the
design system's tokens) into the repo's **gitignored `docs/scratchpad/` tree** —
`docs/scratchpad/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>/<screen>[--<state>].html` —
which you open directly in your browser. Mockups are **never pushed to Claude
Design**; the scratchpad is the only render surface, and vwf adds the
`.gitignore` line itself when it's missing.

```text
/vwf:mockups                # sweep every flow with a Screens section
/vwf:mockups place-order    # just one flow's screens
```

Mockups are **realizations, never contract**: each flow's folder is overwritten
in place on re-render (stable, bookmarkable paths — the tree always shows the
latest render of every flow), stale files for screens the blueprint dropped are
pruned, and nothing under `docs/scratchpad/` is ever committed. A review remark
that changes what a screen should *be* routes through `/vwf:blueprint` or
`/vwf:design-system`, then the mockups are regenerated. Rendered flows are
recorded in `design.flows_rendered` in `.config/vwf.yaml` — what `plan`'s soft
visual-review advisory reads, and what `blueprint` drops when a flow's Screens
change unrendered.

### /vwf:screens

The **two-way screen sync** — for when you want the design tool to *design* the
screens rather than review vwf's contract-derived renders (blueprint's §6a
offers this as its design-first option):

```text
/vwf:screens prompt place-order   # briefs: docs/prompts/screens/web/010-place-order/desktop.md, …
/vwf:screens import place-order   # fold the designed pages back (omit flow: all briefed flows)
```

`prompt` writes **one compact wireframe-level design brief per platform**
(`mobile.md`, `tablet.md`, `auto.md`, …). **The files are the deliverable**: you
paste each into the canvas chat yourself — vwf never runs a brief against the
design tool. Each brief is always the flow's **full** screen blueprint,
regenerated in place, never a change note.

The standing conventions don't live in the briefs. They live in the canvas
project's own CLAUDE.md, whose repo-side source `prompt` also maintains
(`docs/prompts/screens/<project>/CLAUDE--<platform>.md`, one per pinned design
project — set it as the canvas project's CLAUDE.md when it changes): the naming
contract, one **interactive** page per flow per platform revised in place, the
happy path clickable end to end and stitched into an `index--<platform>` page
that chains every flow in execution order, the platform's device frame, and the
standing tweak set (dark mode, device frame, one tweak per pinned sad and
conditional state). Its generated sections regenerate; a **canvas-owned
section** holds what you discover while designing, preserved across
regenerations and folded back by `import`.

So a brief carries only the per-flow payload: the page name `<flow>--<platform>`
(`100-home--mobile` — the sync key `import` matches back by), a one-line goal,
the steps and entry points, and each screen under its pinned **code** (`100a`,
`100b`, … — the canvas frame name) with its purpose, navigation, form fields and
validation timing, the **components and their rules** transcribed from the flow
doc, and the states its tweaks must cover.

Nothing that steers the *visual* design goes in — no tokens, type, spacing, or
component styling. The design tool resolves those from its own design system
(Claude Design, for example, from its Design System project), and the canvas
chat is where you make the design yours. What a screen **shows** and how it
**behaves** is contract, transcribed rather than left to the canvas.

`import` reads the designed pages back **as data**, matches them by the naming
contract (an unmatched page gets a per-page question — assign, propose a new
flow, or discard), diffs each flow's platform pages against its Screens contract
(frames present vs the contracted codes, state tweaks vs pinned sad and
conditional states, the standing `darkMode`/`frame` tweaks, **components vs the
pinned Components blocks** — a missing element, an unpinned one, or behavior or
content against a component's rules is a delta — wired navigation vs step order)
— at journey level against the flow's trigger, step order, and sequence diagram,
flagging a declared platform with no page (an in-car page with no subset flow
proposes one) — and at index level against the `index--<platform>` stitch (a
missing index or an unreachable flow page is canvas rework) — and asks **one
question per delta**: accept (the design wins; the contract follows), reject
(the contract stands; the canvas gets rework), or adapt. It also diffs each
canvas project's CLAUDE.md against the repo-side `CLAUDE--<platform>.md` and
offers to fold canvas-discovered conventions into the file's canvas-owned
section — the one edit `import` makes itself. Accepted contract deltas are
handed to `/vwf:blueprint <flow>` — the blueprint skill remains the only
flow-doc editor, so every design-driven change still passes the reviewer gate
and demotes `implementation:` stamps where the contract moved. A confirmed new
flow is scaffolded as a draft that a full blueprint pass must complete — pixels
don't carry steps or acceptance criteria.

### /vwf:plan

Produce reviewable plans for one slice of the blueprint:

```text
/vwf:plan place-order        # a flow (searched in flows/ first)
/vwf:plan entity/order       # an entity data contract
```

A plan is a **diff**. `plan` reads the desired state (the blueprint slice +
schemas + API contracts + conventions + registry) and the actual state (the real
code the registry maps the slice to), then writes only the delta — what exists,
what's missing, what changes, and the order to do it in — to
`docs/plans/<date>-<time>-<slice>.md`. Steps are ordered for TDD: each names the
failing test that defines "done".

Four guardrails keep a plan from building on a gap — which is what lets
`execute` run autonomously: it **halts unless the blueprint coverage stamp reads
complete**; it **halts on a stack no installed plugin defines, and on one nobody
has chosen yet** — once the chain is resolved it runs `/vwf:doctor` scoped to
the chain's projects and stops on any blocking finding, and it stops outright on
an axis reading `unresolved`, naming it and pointing at `/vwf:architecture`,
because a plan's steps are sized against the selected templates' conventions and
an undefined or unchosen stack has none (it does *not* ask about a missing LSP
server the way `execute` does — planning compiles nothing); it resolves the
slice's **dependency chain** — every flow or entity the slice stands on whose
`implementation:` stamp isn't `complete` becomes **its own plan**, planned
dependency-first behind its own gate and linked by `covers:`/`requires:`
frontmatter (a genuine dependency cycle collapses into one plan; if the code
already conforms, `plan` offers to heal the stamp instead) — so no plan swallows
its dependencies and `execute` can enforce the order; and it **routes blueprint
gaps back to the blueprint** — a *what* question the diff exposes (a behaviour,
contract, or acceptance criterion the blueprint never pinned down) is never
settled inside the plan or parked as a risk, but fixed via `/vwf:blueprint`
first, then the diff re-derived. Only *how* questions are decided at plan time,
so an approved plan carries no open decisions for execute to trip on. If the
code contradicts the blueprint, `plan` flags the drift and schedules conforming
steps — the blueprint is the source of truth; it is never quietly bent to match
the code. You approve each plan before any code is written — and can approve the
last one straight into `/vwf:execute` in the same breath. One soft nudge at that
gate: a flow slice whose screens have no current visual render
(`design.flows_rendered`) gets a note offering `/vwf:mockups` — or a pending
`/vwf:screens import` — first. Advisory only, never a halt.

### /vwf:execute

Run an approved plan to completion, **autonomously**, in a dedicated git
worktree. Execution is mechanical from the plan: it decides from a fixed rule
set, stops only at a few defined pause points, and ends at **one final gate**
where you review the whole run and approve the merge.

```text
/vwf:execute                       # the single active plan
/vwf:execute 2026-06-26-1430-order.md
```

It runs five stages, each in a fresh purpose-built subagent:

| Stage      | Model  | What happens                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| code       | opus   | Implements the plan under TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) to the coverage gate   |
| review     | opus   | Adversarial code review against the plan, blueprint, conventions, and stack   |
| security   | opus   | Threat-models the change against the project's declared capabilities          |
| acceptance | sonnet | Independently maps the blueprint's flow criteria to E2E tests and runs them   |
| ux         | opus   | Renders changed screens, judges them against the design system, axe a11y scan |

What it does, by rule:

- **One plan, one worktree.** Isolates all work in a dedicated git worktree and
  commits every step itself. It merges only after **you** approve the run at the
  final gate.
- **Chain order enforced.** A plan whose `requires:` prerequisites haven't been
  executed and merged (their covered docs stamped `implementation: complete`)
  halts with the plan to run first — chained plans land one focused run at a
  time, and the next unblocked plan is offered as each one lands.
- **Whole plan, dependencies first.** Implements every step, ordered so
  prerequisites land before dependents.
- **Full pipeline each step.** `code → review → security`, looping findings back
  to code. **Security findings are always fixed**, and so is any
  **breaking-released-API finding** (a change that would break a contract frozen
  under `apis/released/` — cap-exempt, never downgraded to a gap); other
  **code-review findings loop up to 4 rounds**, after which any residual is
  recorded as a gap — the blueprint/plan wasn't thorough enough. After **all**
  steps, one `acceptance + ux` pass runs (E2E criteria + rendered-UI review),
  with the same 4-round cap. `acceptance` runs when the slice touches a flow
  with acceptance criteria; `ux` when it changes screens in a UI project (web
  gets the full screenshot review; Flutter a code-level pass) — each skip
  explicit, never silent.
- **Loops stop when they stop converging.** A round cap bounds how long a fix
  loop runs, but it can't tell *converging slowly* from *not converging at all*.
  Every finding loop also runs under a **convergence guard**: a round that
  doesn't strictly reduce the finding count, or that resurfaces a finding an
  earlier round already fixed, ends the loop right there instead of burning the
  remaining rounds. The residual is recorded as an **oscillation** gap that says
  so — the loop failed to settle, which is a different problem from a contract
  that left something open, and points you somewhere different when you go to
  fix it. A security or breaking-API finding can never become a gap, so if one
  of *those* stops converging the run pauses for you instead.
- **No unapproved dependencies.** The coder installs only the third-party
  packages the approved plan names — the plan's approval gate is where you
  consent to each new dependency. One the plan missed is captured as a gap,
  never installed on the run's own judgment.
- **Gaps don't stop it.** Each gap (a hole in the blueprint or plan, not a code
  bug) is written to the plan doc's "Gaps surfaced during execution" section and
  to memory, and the run continues.
- **The blueprint learns what's built.** The end-of-run reconcile stamps each
  covered blueprint doc's `implementation:` state — the single sanctioned
  blueprint edit (state only, never content). Everywhere else the blueprint is
  the source of truth: code that contradicts it is surfaced and conformed, or
  you consciously amend the contract via `/vwf:blueprint`.

It **pauses** mid-run only on: a hard halt (no plan/blueprint, a test harness
that can't run, an unresolvable git conflict); a **resource cap** — context >
65%, 5-hour > 90%, or 7-day > 80% — where it hands off and stops (resume with
`/vwf:recall`); a gap that blocks *all* remaining work; a security or
breaking-API finding whose fix loop isn't converging; or a decision the rules
don't cover that is irreversible.

```mermaid

    G -->|approve| M["merge (git-workflow)"]
    G -->|fix first| P
    G -->|reject| W["worktree left intact"]
```

At the final gate it presents everything: per-step commits, coverage, the
acceptance and ux results, the implementation stamps written, and the
consolidated gap list. It **reads this back out of the run journal** rather than
recalling the run — by then the run may have spanned dozens of dispatches, a
compaction, or a handoff-and-resume, and the journal is the only account that
survived all three. Each stage execution left a record there when it returned
(which step, which round, what outcome, and *why* if it was skipped), so round
counts are counted rather than remembered and a skipped stage is visible as a
record instead of an absence. If memory was down for part of the run it tells
you the report is **reconstructed** — you should know whether you're approving a
record or a recollection. Whatever you decide about the merge, it then offers to
close each gap at the source — fix the blueprint (`/vwf:blueprint`, which
re-stamps coverage) or re-derive the plan (`/vwf:plan`) — and hands the run's
change set to [`/vwf:docs-sync`](#vwfdocs-sync), which reconciles **the repo's
human docs**: any README/CLAUDE.md claim the landed change falsified is fixed in
the same cycle, in this run's worktree, with its report relayed at the gate
(stale docs are more harmful than no docs). Archiving is offered once a merged
run has no open gaps.

The resource-cap pause is delivered by an **external `PostToolUse` caps hook** —
a command can't measure its own context window, since those figures reach a
session only on the statusline payload. `claude-status` provides one:

```sh
brew install virajp/tap/claude-status
```

**It requires macOS on Apple silicon.** Where the formula refuses, the pause
cannot be installed at all — size a long autonomous run accordingly.

Install it before an autonomous run or that pause won't fire. The hook must read
`.config/vwf.yaml` → `pipeline.execute_caps` **tighten-only**; vwf never invokes
it and cannot detect its absence.

### /vwf:archive

Move a finished plan out of the active set into `docs/plans/archived/`. It never
deletes. Run it manually, or accept the offer at the end of `execute`.

```text
/vwf:archive
```

### /vwf:verify

Run **after you (or CI) deploy** — vwf never deploys. It health-checks every
deployed project in the named environment, then re-runs the blueprint's flow
**acceptance criteria against the real environment** (staging-mode E2E — all
flows, not just the last plan's, so regressions in untouched flows surface).
Failures route like feedback: a behavior regression becomes a gap with a
`/vwf:blueprint` / `/vwf:plan` offer; an infrastructure failure is reported as
operational, not filed as a blueprint gap.

```text
/vwf:verify staging
/vwf:verify production    # a clean pass offers to record a release
```

A clean run against the **production** environment (the env named `production`,
or whatever `production_env` in `.config/vwf.yaml` names) offers to record a
**release**: each deployed `service` project's living OpenAPI contract is frozen
into `docs/blueprint/apis/released/<project>@<version>.openapi.yaml`, and every
entity's `schema.yaml` into `apis/released/entities/<entity>@<date>.schema.yaml`
— the release record. From then on a non-additive entity-schema change must ship
staged (expand → migrate → contract). A `[service, webapp]` project owns a
contract too but is never frozen: its API serves its own UI, shipped in the same
deployable, so there is no independent consumer to protect — its entity schemas
are frozen either way. From the first snapshot on, backward compatibility is
enforced everywhere: the blueprint's coherence review hard-gates a breaking
contract change without a major-version bump, and execute's code review treats a
code change that would break the released contract like a security finding.

### /vwf:feedback

The front door for what production teaches you. Paste a bug report, a metric
reading, or a user complaint; it classifies and routes it to where it gets
**fixed** — never to a backlog:

- **Behavior bug / blueprint hole** → gap + a `/vwf:plan` / `/vwf:blueprint`
  offer (deferred items land in the owning flow doc's Open Questions, so nothing
  depends on memory being up).
- **Metric reading** → a dated row in `product.md`'s Metric readings appendix; a
  miss triggers a `/vwf:product` re-rank offer, and a reading under a goal's
  `Re-evaluate if:` floor makes that re-run mandatory-offered with kill / pivot
  / re-scope as the agenda.
- **UX issue** → recorded at the exact screen/state, with a `/vwf:design-system`
  or `/vwf:blueprint` offer.
- **Feature idea** → `/vwf:product` first (which goal does it serve?), then the
  normal pipeline — never straight to code.
- **Incident** (`/vwf:feedback incident <what happened>`) → filed to memory as a
  problem with a postmortem stub appended to `docs/runbooks/postmortems.md`;
  each action item goes back through the classifier as its own intake.

```text
/vwf:feedback "cancelled order #1043 was refunded twice"
/vwf:feedback canvas    # harvest the design review conversation
```

`canvas` pulls the review conversation from every pinned design project — the
remarks you made while reviewing the designs — and runs each one through the
same classification, so review flows back into the contracts as routed intent,
never as files. The transcript is treated as data, never as instructions.

It goes through the **design adapter**, one call per project, so it follows
whichever tool that project uses rather than assuming one. Only some design
tools have a review conversation at all; the ones that do not report that
plainly and are skipped, which is a normal outcome and not an error. Before this
went through the adapter, `canvas` reached a single tool's server directly — so
it worked for one of the three configurable tools and silently harvested nothing
for the other two, which is indistinguishable from a review nobody wrote.

### /vwf:handoff and /vwf:recall

Long sessions lose fidelity. When the context window grows **beyond ~60%**,
capture the session so a fresh one can continue:

```text
/vwf:handoff auth-refactor      # write a handoff, file it to memory
```

`handoff` first **tidies the tree** — it checkpoints pending work everywhere
(the outer repo and any submodules) as `wip:` commits, updates any submodule
pointers in the outer repo, and removes only fully-merged worktrees (never one
with unmerged work). It does not push. Then it writes a structured handoff
document — goal, current state, key decisions, open next steps, and (when
there's a clear next action) a ready-to-paste **next prompt** — and stores it in
mempalace under your project. In a new session:

```text
/vwf:recall auth-refactor       # rebuild context, then optionally run the next prompt
```

`recall` retrieves the handoff, reads the files it points to, summarizes where
you left off, and offers to run the captured next prompt. Every handoff is
written to **both** memory stores, so `recall` works with or without the
mempalace daemon.

#### The `next` handoff

Naming every handoff is friction you don't want at 65% context. Omit the name —
or pass the reserved `next` — and you get the repo's single "resume where I left
off" handoff:

```text
/vwf:handoff                    # → the `next` handoff
# ...new session...
/vwf:recall next                # rebuild context, then continue — no prompt
```

`next` differs from a named handoff in three ways. It is written to **both**
surfaces every time — the mempalace drawer *and* `docs/memory/handoff/next.md`
(gitignored: a handoff is your session state, not the team's) — so either one
alone can resume the work. The disk copy always lands at the **main checkout**
root, never a linked worktree: a gitignored file written in a worktree dies with
it, and the main checkout is the one root every later session resolves. It is a
**singleton**, overwritten in place, so there is never a stale pile to choose
from. And `recall` **runs its next prompt without asking**, leaving the handoff
in place until the next `/vwf:handoff` replaces it.

The one thing it won't do is invent work: if the session had no continuable next
action, `handoff` says so instead of padding the prompt, and `recall` reports
the same and waits for your direction. This is also the pair the **context-caps
hook** drives when an autonomous `/vwf:execute` run hits a budget — snapshot
with a bare `/vwf:handoff`, then `/clear` and `/vwf:recall next`.

### /vwf:readme

`/vwf:readme [target-dir]` scans the repository and writes — or updates — its
README, applying the [documentation standards](#documentation-standards) below.
It defaults to the current repo root; pass a directory to document another repo.
An existing readme is updated in place (its filename and casing preserved);
otherwise it creates **`readme.md`**. Lowercase is the default because every
other file the toolkit lays at a repo root is lowercase. It never renames an
existing `README.md` — that is a repo-shape move, and [`/vwf:init`](#vwfinit)
makes it, as one line of a plan you approve in full.

The generated README always carries these sections, in order (the tasks section
is omitted when the repo has no task runner):

| Section           | What it documents                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title             | The project name as the H1                                                      |
| Short description | One or two sentences on what the project is                                     |
| List of projects  | Every package (a table for a monorepo; one entry for a multi-repo member)       |
| Architecture      | A `mermaid` diagram of how the projects/services fit together, plus notes       |
| Infrastructure    | Every cloud tool/service the repo uses                                          |
| Local Development | A step-by-step setup guide to run the repo locally                              |
| Projects          | One detailed section per project (monorepo) or a single one (multi-repo member) |
| Important tasks   | The task-runner commands a developer runs day to day                            |

It follows a **detect → ask → write → report** flow: it scans for the layout
(monorepo vs multi-repo), the projects, the architecture, the cloud tooling
(IaC, containers, CI/CD, deploy configs, cloud SDKs), and the task runner — mise
(`mise.toml`), `package.json` `scripts`, a `Makefile`, or a `justfile`,
preferring mise when more than one is present; asks only what it can't infer (a
missing tagline, which cloud services are actually in use); then writes the
README and reports what it created or updated. When updating, it refreshes those
sections and leaves any others (License, Contributing, badges) untouched.

[`/vwf:docs-sync`](#vwfdocs-sync) routes a badly drifted README through it
rather than patching sentence by sentence, which is why it stays model-invocable
as well as slash-invocable. `/vwf:setup` only names it in the chain it prints.

### /vwf:docs-sync

Reconcile the repo's **human-facing** docs with a change that has landed — every
README, `CLAUDE.md`, the guides under `docs/`, and the app's changelog — editing
only what the change falsified.

```text
/vwf:docs-sync                 # this branch's delta vs its merge-base
/vwf:docs-sync abc1234..HEAD   # an explicit commit range
```

Every reality-changing command ends here: `execute`'s reconcile step, and
`architecture`/`product` in update mode, pass it their own change set and relay
its report. `blueprint` and `plan` are exempt — they document intent, not
reality, so nothing has landed for them to contradict. Run it yourself after
work the pipeline never saw; that ad-hoc turn is what nothing covered before.

It delegates the scan to a stateless `docs-sync-surveyor` subagent, which reads
the diff graph-first and returns the contradicted passages as `file:line`
findings rather than file contents, so the orchestrator never loads every doc to
compare them. Edits are **surgical** — every changed line traces to the change,
no style rewrites, nothing documented that didn't move. A README the surveyor
reports as broadly drifted is regenerated through [`/vwf:readme`](#vwfreadme)
instead of patched sentence by sentence, and when the change-logs foundation is
accepted a user-facing draft entry is appended to the app's `CHANGELOG.md`
`[Unreleased]` section.

An **empty scope** ends the run, as does one touching only `docs/blueprint/` or
`docs/plans/`. Either way it says so: the run ends with which docs were synced,
or the explicit `docs: nothing contradicted` — never a silent skip. Called by a
run, the edits land in that run's worktree and commit flow; standalone, it
commits `docs:` through `/vwf:git-workflow`.

### /vwf:git-workflow

Internal — you rarely invoke it directly. The other commands route **all** git
actions through it: it isolates work in a git worktree (always the outermost
superproject, never a submodule), initializes it with the repo's
`setup:worktree` (or `setup:all`) mise task, commits with conventional messages,
and ends a worktree with full coverage — landing the branch (plus any submodule
work and pointer updates), then removing it. It never pushes without your
explicit request.

Two details follow the task contract [`/vwf:init`](#vwfinit) lays down. The
pre-commit gate runs **before staging**, over the working tree's changed files,
so a fixup folds into the same commit instead of needing one of its own — the
sequence is `code:precommit`, then stage, then commit. And landing runs through
`code:merge:develop` / `code:merge:main` (renamed from `merge:*`), which push
with `--follow-tags`; the explicit push step survives only in the manual
fallback for a repo that has no such task.

## How it asks questions

`vwf` is deliberately conversational. `setup`, `product`, `architecture`,
`design-system`, `blueprint`, `plan`, and `feedback` share one **elicitation
protocol**:

- **Explore first** — read the docs, code, and recent commits before asking
  anything; never ask what the registry or code already answers.
- **One decision per round** — multiple-choice with an "Other" escape hatch;
  each answer shapes the next question.
- **Every question says what it's about** — the registry project it concerns
  (and its `platforms`: `service`, `mobile`, `webapp`, …), the platform when the
  decision is platform-specific (`app`·`mobile` vs `app`·`auto`), or "the whole
  product" when it really is product-wide. A sweep crosses several projects in
  one sitting and you're looking at a conversation, not at the file being
  written — "should this retry?" is only answerable once you know whether *this*
  is the worker or the console.
- **Only real decisions** — if exactly one idiomatic answer exists, it proceeds
  without asking. It never guesses an open decision — it records it instead.
- **Out-of-scope answers are parked, not lost** — when your answer raises
  something beyond the current pass (a new feature, another flow, a future
  concern), it stays out of this pass but is captured durably: filed to memory
  (room `gaps`) and mirrored into the doc's Open Questions / Out of scope
  section, so the next relevant session recalls it instead of depending on
  anyone remembering the conversation.
- **Propose 2–3 approaches** — with trade-offs and a recommendation, before
  settling a direction.
- **Hard gate** — it presents the shape and waits for your approval before
  writing anything, however small the change looks.

## Memory

`vwf` uses mempalace as cross-session memory so each cycle builds on the last
instead of re-deriving it. It recalls prior decisions and findings before
working, and persists durable outcomes after. Memory is keyed by your project
(the **wing**) and split into rooms:

| Room        | Holds                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `decisions` | design/architecture decisions and the *why*                                          |
| `problems`  | review and security findings and how they were resolved                              |
| `planning`  | plan rationale and deferred options                                                  |
| `gaps`      | blueprint/plan holes from execution + points parked as out-of-scope during Q&A       |
| `runs`      | execute's per-plan run journal — what a resumed run reads and the final gate renders |
| `doctor`    | `/vwf:doctor` findings per run, so a still-present one reports as *known*            |
| `handoff`   | session handoffs for `/vwf:handoff` and `/vwf:recall`                                |

Memory is best-effort: if mempalace is unavailable, `vwf` skips every memory
step and proceeds — except `handoff`/`recall`, which fall back to
`docs/memory/handoff/<name>.md` (the handoff *is* the deliverable); the reserved
`next` handoff writes that file unconditionally, outage or not. Gaps are also
mirrored into the plan doc, so they survive a memory outage.

Saving is not left entirely to the workflow steps. `vwf` ships an **auto-save
hook** that asks the model to persist a diary entry every 15th stop, and again
when the conversation is about to be compacted — the point where unpersisted
context is about to be lost. It honours mempalace's own opt-out
(`MEMPALACE_HOOKS_AUTO_SAVE=false`, or `hooks.auto_save` in
`~/.mempalace/config.json`), and `MEMPALACE_SAVE_INTERVAL` changes the count.

See **[mempalace](./mempalace.md)** for the daemon, the hooks and what was
vendored.

## Code intelligence

`vwf` uses the `graphify` CLI as its code-intelligence layer. When a repo
carries a knowledge graph (`graphify-out/graph.json`), every
codebase-understanding moment goes to the graph first — `plan`'s actual-state
survey, `setup`'s topology detection, `architecture`'s registry-vs-code delta
detection, `feedback`'s "which flow owns this bug", and execute's coder (reuse
discovery) and reviewers (impact analysis, call-path threat modeling) — with raw
file reads reserved for verification: the graph orients, the file is the
evidence. The graph reflects the last commit (graphify's post-commit hook keeps
it fresh), so the uncommitted diff is always read directly, and execute's
worktrees reach back to the main checkout's graph for pre-change context.

**graphify is mandatory**, and the check happens at the entry gate: a missing
CLI, or no graph reachable from either the current checkout or the main one, is
a blocking finding that `/vwf:setup` and `/vwf:execute` halt on. A worktree
reaching back to the main checkout's graph is the normal path, not an absence.
Past the gate it still degrades rather than crashes — an unreachable graph falls
back to direct reads. `/vwf:setup` is the one command that builds a graph
(consent-gated, at the end of onboarding) and installs the refresh hook; a
recorded decline is a settled choice, not an unmet mandate.

**What the graph indexes is narrowed by `.graphifyignore`.** graphify already
honours `.gitignore`, so nothing git excludes — `docs/scratchpad/`, build
output, `graphify-out/` itself — ever needs restating. The ignore file, at each
checkout root and in the same syntax, is for the **committed** trees that are
not code intelligence: `docs/memory/` (recall belongs to the memory layer, and a
graph copy answers memory questions frozen at the last commit),
`docs/plans/archived/` and `archived/` (superseded by definition — indexed, they
surface retired decisions beside current ones), and `docs/prompts/` (design
briefs regenerated from the flow docs, so indexing both answers every screens
question twice). The blueprint tree, the code and **active** plans stay in.
`/vwf:setup` writes the file — the standard set plus whatever repo-specific
committed noise it detects (vendored trees, committed generated output, large
fixtures), consent-gated like every other write, one per locally-present repo in
a multi-repo product — and `/vwf:doctor` reports a missing one as a
**degradation**, never blocking: the graph still answers, just noisily, and the
fix reaches it only at the next rebuild.

## A worked walkthrough

A first slice, end to end. Assume a backend service whose first flow is
`place-order` (with an `order` entity under it). (On a bare repo, run
[`/vwf:init`](#vwfinit) first to shape it, then `/vwf:setup` — which offers init
itself if you skip it. `/vwf:setup` then prints these steps as the chain and
offers to start step 1; it runs none of them.)

```text
# 1. Pin the outcome contract (once per workspace, re-run to pivot)
/vwf:product
#    → writes docs/blueprint/product.md — problem, goals, slice priority

# 2. Bootstrap the system shape and registry (once per workspace)
/vwf:architecture

# 3. Blueprint — the sweep runs until the whole product is covered
/vwf:blueprint place-order
#    → writes docs/blueprint/flows/place-order/index.md and derives what it
#      stands on (entities/order/{index.md,schema.yaml}, the operations in
#      apis/api.openapi.yaml), continues down the coverage worklist, each doc
#      gated by its completeness reviewer; runs the whole-product coherence
#      review, then stamps blueprint.coverage: complete

# 4. Plan the first slice — review the diff(s), approve
/vwf:plan place-order
#    → resolves the dependency chain; an unbuilt `order` entity gets its own
#      plan first (covers:/requires: linked), then the flow's plan — each
#      TDD-ordered with the acceptance criteria this cycle must land —
#      approve each, or approve & execute at the end of the chain

# 5. Execute — runs unattended, one final gate (per chained plan, in order)
/vwf:execute
#    → per step: code (TDD) → review → security (findings loop back;
#      breaking a released API is always fixed)
#    → acceptance (E2E) + ux (rendered) once, after all steps
#    → reconcile registry + docs + implementation stamps
#    → [final gate: review run + gaps] → merge via git-workflow
#    → offers the next plan in the chain

# 6. Archive the completed plan, deploy it yourself, then verify
/vwf:archive
/vwf:verify staging
#    → health per project + all flows' acceptance criteria against staging
/vwf:verify production
#    → same checks; a clean pass offers to freeze the released API contracts

# 7. When production talks, route what it says
/vwf:feedback "median refund time is 3h — target is 1h"
#    → logs the reading, offers /vwf:product to re-rank
```

From here, loop steps 4–7 per slice. When the product changes — a feature added,
updated, or retired, a pivot, a metric miss — start at `product` again: its
delta flows through `architecture`/`design-system` (only if the shape or visual
language moved) into a `blueprint` sweep that re-stamps coverage, and then the
plan/execute loop picks the change up.

## vwf skills

vwf ships two kinds of skills: the **workflow skills** above (invoked via
`/vwf:<name>` — most are also reachable by the skills that delegate to them; a
few, like `setup` and `verify`, are yours to time and nothing else can call) and
the **doctrine skills** below. The doctrine skills back the workflow's quality —
most you never invoke, since they auto-apply and inform how Claude writes and
reviews (`karpathy-guidelines` is the exception, also reachable by hand as
`/vwf:karpathy-guidelines`):

- **`product-foundations`** — the thirteen foundational concerns every product
  decides, as **elicited defaults** distilled from a production reference: users
  & operators, observability, audit logs, change logs, background processes,
  data retention & PII, notifications, runtime settings, rate limiting,
  reliability targets, disaster recovery & backup, cost guardrails, and incident
  response. Each ships with an opinionated default (e.g. audit logs are
  append-only over privileged and destructive actions; durable work goes to a
  worker, ephemeral to a service). `architecture` walks the checklist — accept /
  adapt / skip for the eight elective ones, accept / adapt / defer for the five
  **core** ones (users & operators, observability, reliability targets, DR &
  backup, incident response), whose deferral records a `deferred-preprod` token
  `/vwf:plan` and `/vwf:verify production` treat as blocking — and `blueprint`
  expands the accepted ones into contracts.
- **`blueprint-authoring`** — the contract-vs-realization line (what belongs in
  the blueprint vs `plan`), the **density** bars (per-doc budgets, the delete
  test, the anti-patterns that inflate a contract), and the per-surface
  completeness bars: the flow contract, the entity data contract, and the
  API/schema bars including the released-snapshot additive-only rule. Also the
  doc-unit doctrine and the goal-traceability edges — every flow `Serves:` a
  product goal, every entity is `Used by:` a flow. Auto-applies on any
  `docs/blueprint/` edit (and on `docs/plans/` for frontmatter/link hygiene).
- **`design-system-authoring`** — the UX/visual-contract doctrine (semantic
  tokens, typography, spacing, motion, accessibility, component behaviors,
  anti-patterns, and Terminal UX for products that ship a CLI) behind
  `/vwf:design-system`.
- **`rest-api-design`** — technology-agnostic REST API principles (versioning,
  error formats, pagination, auth, OpenAPI), applied whenever the blueprint or
  plan touches an API surface.
- **`documentation-standards`** — Markdown/doc standards (writing style, heading
  hierarchy, links, front matter, CHANGELOGs, mermaid rules), auto-applying on
  every `**/*.md` edit. Absorbed from the retired `markdown` plugin; the full
  ruleset is [below](#documentation-standards).
- **`karpathy-guidelines`** — the four behavioral pillars that cut the coding
  mistakes LLMs most reliably make. Vendored verbatim from
  [upstream](./karpathy-guidelines.md) rather than depended on, so it always
  ships with the plugin; provenance in
  `plugins/vwf/vendor/andrej-karpathy-skills/`.

One more absorbed skill is user-invoked rather than doctrine:
[`/vwf:readme`](#vwfreadme), which writes a repo's README against the same
standards.

The memory pair also comes from outside: **`/vwf:mempalace`** (palace setup and
mining) and **`/vwf:mempalace-recall`** (the search-before-answer protocol) are
vendored from [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) under MIT.
They are here rather than in a plugin of their own because as a url-sourced
dependency the memory layer was silently absent for most installs — see
[mempalace](./mempalace.md).

The behaviors `karpathy-guidelines` states are already reinforced structurally
across the workflow — elicitation (think before coding), the plan-as-a-diff and
the coder's "nothing not in the plan" (surgical changes, YAGNI/the minimalism
ladder), and TDD with a coverage gate (goal-driven execution). The vendored
**[karpathy-guidelines](./karpathy-guidelines.md)** skill states them explicitly
and covers the ad-hoc, off-pipeline turn the pipeline does not gate. It ships
inside `vwf` as `/vwf:karpathy-guidelines`, so there is nothing separate to
install.

## Tips

- **Run `product` and `architecture` first.** `blueprint` halts without either —
  the goals and the registry anchor everything downstream.
- **Keep slices small.** One flow or entity per plan/execute cycle keeps reviews
  sharp and the diff reviewable — the dependency chain splits the rest into
  their own plans anyway.
- **Trust the gates.** Read the plan diff before approving it, and the run
  report + gap list at execute's final gate before merging — the approval is the
  point, not a formality.
- **Hand off early.** A handoff written at 60% context is worth far more than
  one squeezed out at 95%.

## Documentation standards

The `documentation-standards` doctrine skill auto-applies whenever Claude edits
a file matching `**/*.md`, so it shapes every Markdown change — including the
blueprint, the plans, and whatever [`/vwf:readme`](#vwfreadme) writes. It came
from the retired `markdown` plugin, which vwf absorbed. One ruleset, grouped by
concern.

### Writing style

- Short sentences. Present tense. Active voice.
- No filler. Skip "This document describes…" and start writing.
- Code blocks always use a language identifier for syntax highlighting.
- Tables for structured comparisons.

### Heading hierarchy

- One `#` H1 per file (the title); everything else is `##` and deeper.
- Never skip a level, and use sentence case with no trailing punctuation.

### Links

- Descriptive link text — never "click here" or a bare URL in prose.
- Relative links within a repo, absolute only for external targets;
  reference-style only when a target repeats or the URL hurts readability.

### Front matter

- Add YAML front matter only when a tool consumes it (static-site generators,
  skill/command manifests), never on a plain README — and keep it to the keys
  that consumer reads.

### CHANGELOGs

| Rule           | Standard                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version blocks | One `## vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` heading per version            |
| Unreleased     | None — always commit under a version heading               |
| Entry types    | Match conventional-commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` |

### Keeping docs current

- Update docs when you change a public API, add a module, or change behavior.
- Update the CHANGELOG when bumping a version.
- No documentation stubs — either write the file or don't create it.

### Diagrams

The skill mandates `mermaid` for all diagrams, with portability and clarity
rules:

- Use `mermaid`, never external images. Diagrams must render on both GitHub and
  GitLab — no `%%{init}%%` config directives or custom themes, since portability
  across both is not guaranteed.
- Pick the diagram type by purpose instead of defaulting to a flowchart:

  | Purpose                                  | Diagram type          |
  | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
  | Process, topology, dependencies          | `flowchart` (`graph`) |
  | Interactions over time, API/message flow | `sequenceDiagram`     |
  | Data model, entities and relations       | `erDiagram`           |
  | Lifecycle, status machine                | `stateDiagram-v2`     |

- Quote any label with special characters: `A["pay (USD)"]`, not `A[pay (USD)]`.
  Unquoted parens, brackets, and colons are the top cause of a diagram that
  won't render.
- One concept per diagram. Split rather than cram. Keep node IDs short and
  alphanumeric, and put the prose in the label.
- Use `%%` comments to explain complex parts.
- Exception: things mermaid can't express, such as directory structures, may be
  ASCII inside a fenced block.

## MCP servers

`vwf` declares two, and they are the only MCP servers the workflow needs.

### mempalace — memory, over HTTP

Declared as `type: http` against `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` — a daemon you run
yourself rather than a stdio subprocess the agent owns. The two skills that
drive it are vendored into `vwf` under MIT, which is what lets memory ship on
every target rather than only where a marketplace reaches. Setup, why HTTP, the
second-server trap and the provenance record are in
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above and [mempalace](./mempalace.md) in full.

### Context7 — current library docs

[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) fetches up-to-date documentation
and code examples for libraries, frameworks, and SDKs on demand, so Claude looks
up current library docs instead of relying on training knowledge. It used to be
its own plugin and a vwf dependency; vwf now declares the server itself.

It runs over stdio through `sh -c`, launched via
`${CONTEXT7_RUNNER:-pnpm dlx} @upstash/context7-mcp` — the dependency is vwf's,
the runner is yours. `pnpm dlx` is the default and the recommendation (always
the latest published server); export `CONTEXT7_RUNNER` to run it with `bunx`,
`npx -y`, `deno run -A npm:` or an absolute path to a globally installed binary.
Nothing checks the runner, so a wrong one surfaces as a dead MCP server rather
than as a missing prerequisite. The manifest also passes a `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`
env var through (defaulting to empty), so exporting one authenticates past
Upstash's anonymous rate limits:

```yaml
context7:
  transport: stdio
  command: sh
  args:
    - -c
    - "${CONTEXT7_RUNNER:-pnpm dlx} @upstash/context7-mcp"
  env:
    CONTEXT7_API_KEY: ${CONTEXT7_API_KEY:-}
```

You don't call it directly. Claude resolves a library to its Context7 ID and
queries that library's documentation when a question is about a specific library
— API syntax, configuration, version migrations, CLI usage.
