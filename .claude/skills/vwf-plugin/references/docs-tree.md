# The docs vwf maintains, OKF, and format versioning

The tree the workflow skills write into a product repo, why it is an OKF bundle,
and how the two format stamps work.

Docs the commands maintain live under `docs/blueprint/` (the outcome contract
`product.md` — problem/users/goals/slice-priority + the `/vwf:feedback`-owned
Metric readings appendix + the optional Tiers & entitlements matrix — the
machine-readable registry `registry.yaml` beside its prose view
`architecture.md`, `conventions.md`, the product-wide `design-system.md`, the
per-project env-var/secret catalog `environment.md`; **one flow folder per flow,
grouped by primary registry project and numbered in execution order** —
`flows/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/index.md` at one uniform depth for UI and non-UI
projects alike — `index.md` holding the **platform-agnostic contract** (trigger,
actors, steps, diagram, jobs, acceptance; no screens) beside one
**`<platform>.md` per implemented platform** (`mobile`/`tablet`/`desktop`/
`auto`/`site`/`webapp`) carrying that platform's Screens (rows coded
`<NNN><letter>`, codes **shared across platform files**, each with its
per-screen Components block); a non-UI flow is `index.md` alone, as is a `cli`
project's — the seventh platform is a terminal surface with no screens, so it
takes no platform file and never reaches the canvas, mockups or the scratchpad,
and a cli-only project is exempt from the standard-flows mandates. Numbers are
**designated** — `100` is always `home`, `010` splash / `020` signin / `030`
recover-account / `040` onboarding, `110`–`890` product flows, `910`–`940` the
account screens — on one number line per project. `flows/index.md` is the
catalog (per-project sections, numeric order, a Platforms column) +
inter-service contracts; **one entity folder per entity** — `entities/<entity>/`
holding exactly `index.md` + `schema.yaml` — with `entities/index.md` the
catalog + product-wide erDiagram; and the API contracts
`apis/<project>.openapi.yaml` — one per API-publishing project, one declaring
the `service` platform — plus the frozen `apis/released/` snapshots, which a
`service` with no co-declared screen platform alone gets (a `[service, webapp]`
project's API serves its own UI, so no independent consumer needs the freeze),
and `apis/released/entities/<entity>@<date>.schema.yaml`, frozen at the same
moment for every entity regardless of project shape; the blueprint root holds
only the system docs), `docs/plans/` (two forms side by side — `/vwf:plan`'s
cycle plans as flat `<date>-<time>-<slice>.md` files, discovered through the
base repo's `docs/plans/index.md`, and `/vwf:change-plan`'s ad-hoc change
folders `<date>-<name>/`, each an `index.md` plus one file per unit and
deliberately **never** listed in that index; `/vwf:archive` retires **either**
shape — a flat file with its index row, or a folder moved whole with only its
Status line rewritten and no row to fix — and `/vwf:change-execute` archives its
own folder at landing, everything into `archived/`), `docs/runbooks/`
(per-project operational runbooks plus `postmortems.md`, seeded by the
incident-response foundation and appended to by `/vwf:feedback incident`), and
`docs/prompts/` (`<type>/<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>.md` — canvas design
briefs grouped by prompt type → registry project → flow, one brief per platform
regenerated in place (the filename carries the platform, mirroring the flows
tree exactly), plus the per-design-project canvas conventions files
`screens/<project>/CLAUDE--<platform>.md`; written by `/vwf:screens prompt`;
committed intent artifacts, not blueprint docs), and `docs/scratchpad/`
(**gitignored, never committed** — the mockup render tree,
`<project>/<NNN>-<flow>/<platform>/<screen-slug>[--<state>].html`, written by
`/vwf:mockups` and blueprint §6a, overwritten in place per flow; vwf auto-adds
the `.gitignore` line when missing). Superseded commands/agents/templates are
archived under `archived/vwf-<date>/` (`vwf-2026-06-19/` from the prior model;
`vwf-2026-07-04/` holds the retired `autopilot` command, whose behavior merged
into `execute`; `vwf-2026-07-07/` the format-8 `integration.md` template,
dissolved into the flow templates).

The `docs/blueprint/` tree is an **OKF bundle** — vwf is an opinionated
*profile* of Google's Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1. Every doc is a typed OKF
concept: mandatory YAML frontmatter (`type` from a fixed vocabulary —
`vwf-product`/`vwf-architecture`/`vwf-conventions`/`vwf-design-system`/
`vwf-environment`/`vwf-flow`/`vwf-flow-platform`/`vwf-integration` (the flow
catalog)/`vwf-entity`/`vwf-entities`/`vwf-plan`/`vwf-change-plan` (an ad-hoc
change plan `docs/plans/<date>-<name>/index.md`; the blueprint completeness bars
do not apply to it)/`vwf-gap-report` — plus `title`, `description`, `status`;
optional `timestamp`/`owner`/`resource`/`tags`; flow/entity docs additionally
carry the pipeline-owned `implementation:` build stamp), and cross-doc
relationships are typed markdown links (the OKF edge) rather than prose. YAML
artifacts (`registry.yaml`, `schema.yaml`, `*.openapi.yaml`) are typed by
**path**, not frontmatter (the OpenAPI files carry only `info.x-vwf.status`).
This makes a blueprint portable to any OKF-aware tool (e.g. the OKF static-HTML
visualizer) and ingestable by graphify, and lets the `blueprint-reviewer` verify
frontmatter + that every edge resolves. The doctrine lives in the
blueprint-authoring skill's `frontmatter-and-links` reference.

**Format versioning.** vwf ships the stamp in `assets/blueprint-format`
(currently **24**). Since vwf 18 the stamps are **drift detectors only** —
nothing selects a migration by them. There is no `N → N+1` delta ladder for the
blueprint format: a stale stamp sends `/vwf:setup` into its `migrate` mode,
which **reconciles the tree against the current format's own sources**
(`assets/templates/`, `assets/examples/blueprint/`, the blueprint-authoring
bars, `assets/vwf-config.md`) rather than replaying steps, resolving retired
spellings through the lineage table in
`skills/setup/references/format-lineage.md` and confirming by MCQ any spelling
that fans out to more than one current one. There is therefore no support
window: any stamp reconciles to the shipped one. **Do not restate the per-format
history here** — what each past format changed is git's job; a second narrative
copy is precisely the drift the density doctrine warns about, and it was 105
lines of this file before format 16. The *current* shape is what this section
describes throughout; the paired `config_format` (currently **16**) is described
under `assets/vwf-config.md`, and its own `N → N+1` deltas do still live there —
state-based reconciliation replaced the **blueprint** ladder only. The two
stamps are separate number lines, which have now drifted apart in both
directions: `14` and `16` shipped without a blueprint bump (the first closed the
stack menu; the second gave each stack axis its `unresolved` state and made
`deploy_template` a list) and `21` shipped without a config bump (it only moved
one config file). `22`/`15` shipped **together**, as `19`/`12` and `20`/`13` did
— the config's `template` pin and `ui:` key both depend on the platform
vocabulary, so a repo on one but not the other is a state neither migration
expects. `23` and `24` each then shipped alone and purely additively: the first
lifts the blueprint-coverage exemption for the `plugin` platform, retires no
spelling, and needs no config key.
