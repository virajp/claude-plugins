# The plan folder template

`docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<kebab-name>/` holds `index.md` and one `NN-<unit>.md`
per unit. Every section below is required. The frontmatter and the **Status**,
**Consent**, **Units** and **Run log** blocks have a fixed shape: execute-plan
parses them and rewrites the status column and the run log, so keep the headings
and the column order exactly.

Two archived plans are the worked specimens: `2026-09-01-devtools-dissolution`
for waves and the shared-file rule, `2026-09-02-doctrine-gaps` for the folder
form and the unit prompt.

## Consent

| Action                                       | Granted                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Merge to `develop` and push on green run     | yes / no                     |
| Stage locally (`plugins:local`) on green run | yes / no                     |
| Release `vwf` publicly                       | none / patch / minor / major |
| Release `stackgen` publicly                  | none / patch / minor / major |
| Release installer publicly                   | none / patch / minor / major |

**A release is two stages.** The local one — `mise run plugins:local` — stages
the changed plugins into the dev marketplace and updates this machine's install;
it publishes nothing, so execute-plan runs it without a further prompt and only
reports what it staged. The public one is the tags, and it is what the release
rows above are about: they are intent, and execute-plan stops once before the
`main` merge and the tags and asks, per `CLAUDE.md`. A staged plugin loads only
in a **restarted** session.

## Goal

<one paragraph: what is true after this lands. Then the framing that produced
the plan, and any reversal of a standing decision, named as one.>

## Facts the survey established

<what recall and the Explore pass found, so no unit re-derives it: counts,
paths, the gates that cover the trees, the docs that describe today's behaviour,
the dependencies each tree already has>

## Assumed decisions — confirm or override at review

| # | Decision | Ruling | Rejected | Unit |
| - | -------- | ------ | -------- | ---- |

## New dependencies

<one line per package: name, what for, the existing thing it was preferred over,
the unit that adds it — or "none". A unit adds nothing not listed here.>

## Units

Status is one of `pending`, `running`, `green`, `failed`, `unresolved`,
`skipped`.

## Waves

<one line per wave: which units, why they are safe together>

## Wave gate

`mise run plugins:check`, `mise run plugins:marketplace --check`,
`mise run plugins:inventory --check`, `pnpm vitest run`,
`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p installer` and `-p scripts`,
`mise run plugins:npm-normalize-test`, `mise run site:check` when any unit owns
something under `site/`, plus the wave review, plus every report read for
`UNRESOLVED:`. <Add the plan's own checks here.>

## Gates the orchestrator keeps

<what cannot be proven by a diff: target-verifier runs, scratch-repo smoke
tests, each with its pass condition>

## Unit contract

Every unit prompt carries, in order: its ruling quoted from this file, its owned
paths plus "touch nothing outside this list", the facts section, the shared-file
rule, and the return block below. A unit never bumps a version, never runs a
generator, never edits a doc, never adds a dependency this file does not list,
never commits.

A unit returns exactly this block and nothing else — no file contents, no diff:

    CHANGED: <path> — <one line>            (one per file)
    DECIDED: <what> — <why>                 (choices made inside scope, or none)
    DOCS FALSIFIED: <path> — <passage>      (reported, never edited; or none)
    GAP: <what the plan left unspecified and the assumption taken>   (or none)
    UNRESOLVED: <the ruling needed>         (or none)

A `GAP:` is a hole in the plan the unit could proceed past on a stated
assumption; it is recorded and the run continues. An `UNRESOLVED:` is a ruling
the unit could not proceed without; it blocks the unit and its dependents.

## Out of scope

<each declined item, with the reason>

## Parked

<each item raised during the interview that belongs to a later plan, with enough
context to pick it up — or "none">

## Run log

<written by execute-plan; empty at approval>

| Wave | Unit | Model | Round | Outcome | Detail | Commit |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ |

## Launch

Run in a fresh session:

/execute-plan docs/plans/<date>-<name>
```

## NN-<unit>.md

```markdown
# U<n> — <title>

- **Wave:** <n>
- **Depends on:** <ids or —>
- **Owns:** <explicit paths>
- **Model:** <inherit | a named tier>
- **Read first:** every owned file, top to bottom, before editing.
- **Lazy-load:** <files to open only if an edit needs them>

## Ruling

<quoted verbatim from index.md's assumed decisions and the user's answers —
never paraphrased>

## Edits

1. **`<path>`** — <what changes, precisely enough that two readers would make
   the same edit>
2. …

## Verification

- <the gate lines this unit must pass before returning>
- <grep-level checks specific to the edit>

## Guardrails

- Do not touch <the neighbour another unit owns>.
- <the trap specific to this tree — dprint, strict-YAML frontmatter, BSD sed,
  byte-copy not retype>

## Commit

`<type>: <description>` — written by the orchestrator after the wave gate, not
by the unit.
```

## The two fixed final units

**Docs.** Dispatched as the `docs-reconciler` agent with the run's diff, then a
`general-purpose` unit applying its findings plus every `DOCS FALSIFIED:` line
the earlier units returned and the list from index.md's survey facts. Under
`CLAUDE.md`'s rule docs ship with the change, so this unit is never optional. A
confirmed reversal from the interview also lands here, as a
`docs/memory/decisions/<date>-<slug>.md`.

**Gates and bump.** Bumps each released project's version per the consent block
(`plugin.json` by hand, the installer via `mise run i:version`), runs
`mise run plugins:marketplace` and `mise run plugins:inventory`, and passes the
full wave gate. Runs `target-verifier` when `plugins/` or `installer/` changed.
Its report is the run's final gate.

It does **not** run `mise run plugins:local` — that is the orchestrator's, after
the landing, because the task mutates the machine's own plugin install rather
than the tree under review, and a unit never reaches outside the worktree.
