# Release

**Ask the user before running `i:release`, `plugins:release` or
`site:release`.** It is the repo's hard rule, and all three tasks tag and push.

**There are three independent things to release, and one tag family each.** Ask
which is meant before doing anything; the answer is usually visible in what
changed.

| Releasing           | Tag                    | Task              | Ends at                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| one or more plugins | `<name>-v<version>`    | `plugins:release` | the pushed tag           |
| the installer CLI   | `installer-v<version>` | `i:release`       | npm + GitHub Release     |
| the website         | `site-v<version>`      | `site:release`    | Workers + GitHub Release |

When plugins, installer and site release together, cut them from the same `main`
merge in that order — plugins, installer, site — each with its own note.

The namespaces must all stay prefixed. GitHub's tag globs match any character
except `/`, so a bare `v*` family matched `vwf-v19.9.0` and fired the npm
publish on a plugin release — which is why `release.yml` filters `installer-v*`.
The 54 pre-2026-08-30 `v1.2.1`–`v6.0.0` tags are history; nothing fires on them,
and they are deliberately left unprotected.

**Adding a fourth tag family means widening the ruleset.** GitHub's
`release-tags` ruleset blocks deletion and re-pointing for `refs/tags/*-v*`,
which covers all three families above and every plugin ref the generator can
emit — a test pins their shape to `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*-v\d+\.\d+\.\d+/`, and
`site-v1.0.0` matches both, so the site family needed no widening. A family
without `-v` in the name (`nightly-2026-09`, say) simply falls outside the
pattern and gets **no** protection, silently: nothing fails, it is just
unguarded. Either give the new family a `-v` or widen
`conditions.ref_name.include` to `["~ALL"]` on ruleset `21871515`.

## Local first

**A plugin is staged locally before it is tagged publicly.** The staging command
is `mise run plugins:local`: it copies each changed plugin into the gitignored
dev marketplace under `X.Y.Z+N` and updates this machine's install, so the
author runs the plugin they are about to publish. It commits nothing, pushes
nothing and cuts no tag; `/execute-plan` runs it unprompted at the end of a
green run, and a hand-made change reaches it the same way.

So, before `plugins:release`, confirm the plugin being tagged has been staged
and actually exercised — in a **restarted** session, since skills are read at
session start. If it has not, offer to run `plugins:local` and stop there; the
tag can be cut in the next session and nothing is lost by waiting. This is a
question, not a gate: the user can say the change is docs-only, or that they
have exercised it another way, and that answer stands.

Two limits, both worth stating rather than papering over:

- **It covers plugins only.** The installer's and the website's nearest local
  steps are `mise run i:test` and `mise run site:check` — gates over the built
  artifact, not an install of it, so they prove less. `site:dev` serves the site
  locally and is the closest thing the website has to running the real change.
- **It refuses in user mode**, where the registered marketplace is the published
  one — it would otherwise re-copy the last release, which is the state it
  exists to escape. Setup is `.claude/docs/dev-marketplace.md`. A refusal is
  reported, never routed around.

## Releasing plugins

Each entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` pins its plugin to a
`<name>-v<version>` tag, and that ref is **derived** from the plugin manifest's
`version`. So bumping a version is what declares a release; the task only
materializes the tag the manifest already names.

```sh
# on develop: bump plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json, then
mise run plugins:marketplace     # the ref renames itself
# merge develop → main, then
mise run plugins:release --dry-run
mise run plugins:release
```

The tracked version is plain `X.Y.Z` always; the `X.Y.Z+N` the authoring machine
runs between releases exists only in the gitignored staged copies
`plugins:local` writes, and `plugins:check` fails a manifest that carries one.

`plugins:release` tags only the plugins whose ref has no tag yet, so a plugin
whose version did not move is skipped and its entry stays byte-identical — that
is what makes releases per-plugin. It refuses to run off `main`, on a dirty
tree, or against a stale manifest.

**No GitHub Release and no npm publish.** The tag *is* the release. Users move
with `claude plugin marketplace update virajp-plugins` (re-reads the pins) then
`claude plugin update <name>` (fetches them) — both steps, or nothing moves.

If `plugins.yml` goes red on `main` with *"marketplace.json pins X, which is not
a tag"*, the merge landed and the tags did not. Run `plugins:release`.

## Releasing the installer CLI

Releasing via CI is preferred over the local `i:publish`, so every version keeps
the strongest npm trust level (trusted publisher).

### 1. Bump on develop, merge to main

`main` is merge-only — the `no-commit-to-branch` hook blocks a commit there — so
`i:release` neither bumps nor commits. It is the same shape as
`plugins:release`: tag what has already landed.

```sh
# on develop
mise run i:version              # patch; --minor / --major to choose the bump
git add package.json && mise x -- git commit -m "ops: bump installer to X.Y.Z"
# merge develop → main
```

### 2. Cut the tag

```sh
# on main
mise run i:release
```

It requires a clean tree **and `main`**, refuses if `installer-vX.Y.Z` already
exists (which means `package.json` was never bumped for this release), runs
`i:test`, creates the annotated tag, then — interactively — pushes **`main`
first and the tag second** and watches the `release.yml` run with
`gh run watch --exit-status`, so the task only succeeds if the publish pipeline
does. It needs `gh` installed and authenticated.

The push order is load-bearing: `release.yml` checks the tagged commit is
reachable from `origin/main`, so a tag arriving before the branch fails that
gate. `plugins:release` pushes tags alone because no plugin tag is checked for
reachability.

`--ci` stops after the tag, with no push and no watch. `deps-update.yml` passes
it, having done its own bump, commit and merge first. Do not pass it by hand.

### 3. Cut the GitHub Release

Every `installer-vX.Y.Z` tag carries one — the tag is the npm-publish trigger,
the Release is the human-readable record beside it. The mapping is **1:1**, so a
missing Release means a missed step. Plugin tags get no Release.

```sh
gh release create installer-vX.Y.Z --title installer-vX.Y.Z \
  --notes-file <notes> --verify-tag
```

- **Creating a Release never publishes.** `release.yml` triggers on
  `push: tags: installer-v*`; nothing listens for `release` events.
  `--verify-tag` keeps it that way by refusing to invent a tag — which *would*
  push and publish.
- **`--latest` resolves by publish date**, so a normal forward release is
  correct by default. Pass `--latest=false` when backfilling out of order.

## Releasing the site

The website deploys only from a `site-v<version>` tag; a merge to `main` ships
nothing. Same shape as the installer: bump on `develop`, tag on `main`.

### 1. Bump on develop, merge to main

```sh
# on develop
mise run site:version           # patch; --minor / --major to choose the bump
git add site/package.json && mise x -- git commit -m "ops: bump site to X.Y.Z"
# merge develop → main
```

### 2. Cut the tag

```sh
# on main
mise run site:release
```

It requires a clean tree **and `main`**, refuses if `site-vX.Y.Z` already exists
(which means `site/package.json` was never bumped for this release), runs
`mise run site:check`, creates the annotated tag, then — interactively — pushes
**`main` first and the tag second** and watches the `site.yml` run with
`gh run watch --exit-status`, so the task only succeeds if the deploy does. The
push order is load-bearing for the same reason as the installer's: `site.yml`
checks the tagged commit is reachable from `origin/main`.

`--ci` stops after the tag, with no push and no watch. Nothing passes it today;
do not pass it by hand.

### 3. Cut the GitHub Release

Every `site-vX.Y.Z` tag carries one, in the note format below — the same 1:1
rule as the installer's.

```sh
gh release create site-vX.Y.Z --title site-vX.Y.Z \
  --notes-file <notes> --verify-tag
```

`site.yml` triggers on `push: tags: site-v*`; creating a Release never deploys,
and `--verify-tag` refuses to invent a tag that would.

## The note format

Follow `.config/git-conventional-commits.yaml` — the same config the repo
already uses. **Do not invent a second changelog format.**

- Eligible types are `feat`, `fix` and `refactor`, plus breaking changes.
  `includeInvalidCommits: false`, so `ops:` / `docs:` / `blueprint:` / `merge:`
  are excluded. Commits matching `^[wW][iI][pP]\b` are skipped.
- Headlines: **Features**, **Bug Fixes**, **Performance Improvements**,
  **Merges**, **BREAKING CHANGES**.
- Scopes are bolded; each entry links its commit via
  `https://github.com/virajp/claude-plugins/commit/%commit%`.

Shape of the note, in order:

1. An optional `**Plugin versions:**` line — **only** the marketplace entries
   whose version changed since the previous tag. Informational: those plugins
   ship on their own tags, not on this one.
2. The changelog sections.
3. A `**Full Changelog**` compare link.

A tag with no eligible commits still gets a Release, saying it is a maintenance
release.

## Facts that make a failed publish legible

- **npm allows exactly one Trusted Publisher per package, and it validates the
  entry-point workflow's *filename*** — so it is set to `release.yml` only.
  `workflow_call` therefore does **not** work: the repo shipped it that way for
  two months and both monthly runs died at the publish step with `ENEEDAUTH`,
  because npm saw `deps-update.yml` and matched nothing. `deps-update.yml`
  publishes by **dispatching** `release.yml` on the new tag.
- **Refs pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not start workflow runs** — but
  `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` are explicit exceptions, which
  is why no PAT or GitHub App token is needed. The dispatch is fire-and-forget;
  the `release.yml` run is the publish record.
- **The publish step is idempotent**: it skips (does not fail) if that version
  is already on npm, so tag re-points, dispatch retries and re-runs are safe.
- `release.yml` gates on `osv-scanner` over the lockfile before publishing, so
  an unpatched advisory in a transitive dep blocks the release. The remedy is an
  entry in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `overrides`, not a bypass.
- **Publishing uses the npm CLI; everything else stays pnpm.**
- **No publish path may move into another file** — that is why plugin validation
  lives in the separate `plugins.yml`, which publishes nothing and holds no
  `id-token` permission. Narrowing *which tags* reach `release.yml` is a
  different thing and is safe: npm matches the filename, not the trigger. That
  is what let the tag filter become `installer-v*`.

## Before cutting

Confirm the working tree is clean, that a plugin release has been through the
local stage above, and that the change being released has its docs reconciled —
`readme.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `site/src/content/docs/plugins/<plugin>.md` ship
with the change, not after it.
