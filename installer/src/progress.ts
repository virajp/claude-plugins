/**
 * The live indicator, shown while a run is working.
 *
 * **Deliberately not an animated spinner.** Every step shells out through
 * `spawnSync`, which blocks the event loop for the whole of each `claude`
 * invocation — so a `setInterval` spinner would stop on one frame for
 * exactly the seconds it is meant to reassure you, and a frozen spinner reads
 * as a hang rather than as work. What moves here is the *step*, which advances
 * only when something real has finished.
 *
 * It writes to **stderr**, like the report it precedes, so stdout stays
 * parseable for `--dry-run | jq`.
 *
 * Off entirely when stderr is not a TTY. Piped or redirected output has no
 * cursor to rewrite, so the escape codes would land in the file as literal
 * junk and each transient step would be a permanent line — for a run whose
 * result is the table printed at the end anyway.
