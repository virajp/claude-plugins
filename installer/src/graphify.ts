/**
 * Wiring graphify, which vwf treats as mandatory.
 *
 * This is not a nicety. vwf's graphify protocol is enforced at its own entry
 * gate: `/vwf:doctor` reports a missing CLI or a missing graph as **blocking**,
 * and both `setup` and `execute` halt on one. So a machine with vwf and no
 * graphify wiring has a plugin that refuses to run — the worst shape of failure,
 * because nothing connects it back to the install.
 *
 * `graphify install` is idempotent, so re-running self-heals a setup the user has
 * since broken.
 *
 * **It used to run only for targets that had just taken a vwf install**, and
 * neither half of that condition exists any more: plugins are installed by
 * `claude plugin install`, which this CLI never sees, and
 * `graphify install --platform opencode` went with the OpenCode support. So this
 * runs whenever a run reaches it, for Claude alone. Wiring graphify on a machine
 * with no vwf costs an idempotent no-op; *not* wiring it on a machine that has
 * vwf costs every vwf command.

/**
 * Run graphify's own setup.
 *
 * Soft-skips throughout, and that matters more than it did. The `requires:`
 * install gate used to refuse a vwf install with no `graphify` on PATH, so
 * reaching this without it meant the gate had been bypassed; that gate is gone
 * with the plugin installs, so an absent graphify is now the ordinary case on a
 * machine installing a plugin that does not need it. Failing the run for it
 * would refuse an install that otherwise succeeded, over a tool the user may not
 * want. `/vwf:doctor` is what reports it as blocking, for the plugin that does.
