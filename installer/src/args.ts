/**
 * The flag surface, parsed by the platform.
 *
 * **`node:util`'s `parseArgs` replaced `citty`, and the reason was a bug rather
 * than a preference.** citty's `ArgType` is `boolean | string | enum |
 * positional` — no array kind — so a repeated flag is not expressible in it at
 * all and the last occurrence silently wins. `--user vwf --user stackgen`
 * installed only `stackgen` and said nothing about the name it dropped.
 *
 * **`--user` and `--project` are repeatable again**, and `multiple: true` is
 * the sanctioned mechanism — the array kind citty could not express, which is
 * how `--user vwf --user stackgen` once installed only `stackgen` and said
 * nothing about the name it dropped. `parseArgs` stays regardless: it is the
 * platform, it costs no dependency, and it works on this package's
 * `engines.node` floor (verified on 18.20.8).
 *
 * The one thing citty did that the platform does not is **usage rendering**, so
 * `renderUsage` below is ours. It is not a loss: the no-request path has to
 * print help anyway, so this was going to exist.
 *
 * `strict` is on, so an unknown flag is an **error naming itself** rather than
 * a silent no-op. That is what makes a retired flag legible instead of ignored
 * — which is how `--platform`, `--upgrade`, `--force` and `--statusline` all
 * answer.
