/**
 * The CLI entrypoint.
 *
 * This file is the *source*; `bin/` holds what tsup builds from it, and `bin/`
 * is what npm publishes. The hashbang above is not decoration — tsup copies it
 * through and marks the output executable, which is what lets `package.json`'s
 * `bin` entry point straight at the bundle.
 *
 * **The CLI has two jobs**: plugins, and an interactive `--uninstall`. Plugins are installed by **driving Claude Code's own commands**
 * against this repo on GitHub —
 * `claude plugin marketplace add virajp/claude-plugins` then `claude plugin
 * install` per plugin (`install.ts`) — so the four plugin adapters, the payload
 * copy, `--platform` and the `requires:` dependency gate stay gone, along with
 * `plan.ts` and `executor.ts`. What is left is short enough that `run` below
 * *is* the orchestration.
 *
 * Argument parsing lives in `args.ts`, on `node:util`'s `parseArgs`.
