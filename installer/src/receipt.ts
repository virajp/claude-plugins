/**
 * Install receipts — what an install touched, and what was there before it.
 *
 * The old installer removed things by *inferring* what it must have written:
 * it deleted the keys it knew it set, and left anything it was unsure about.
 * That is safe only while the inference stays true, and it silently is not
 * whenever a user edits a value the installer later removes wholesale.
 *
 * A receipt records the prior state instead, so `revert` restores rather than
 * guesses. The invariant it exists to make testable: **install then remove
 * leaves the tree and every touched config byte-identical.**
 *
 * **This module is read-only now.** Nothing this version installs writes a
 * receipt — plugins go in through `claude plugin install`, and Claude keeps its
 * own records, which is what `--uninstall` reads live. So the builder and the
 * writer are gone, and what is left is the reader and `revert`, for the receipts *older* versions left on
 * disk: the copied Claude marketplace payload, and the multi-target adapters'
 * before it. Every `Entry` kind stays reachable in `revert` for that reason —
 * dropping one would turn an existing receipt into a file nothing can undo.
 *
 * If something here ever writes again, `writeReceipt` is in git and its merge
 * semantics are the part worth recovering rather than re-deriving: an install
 * is not a run, and each run overwriting the record wholesale is the
 * receipt-completeness bug that recurred across all four adapters.
