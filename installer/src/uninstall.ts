/**
 * `--uninstall`: enumerate what this toolkit put on the machine, let the user
 * deselect, then remove each piece through whatever owns it.
 *
 * **This replaced a receipt-driven, all-or-nothing flag**, and the reason is
 * that its premise stopped being true. It reverted one receipt per target, which
 * worked while every install went through this CLI; plugins are now installed by
 * `claude plugin install` from a GitHub-served marketplace, so the receipt knows
 * nothing about them and an uninstall that only reads receipts would report
 * success having left every plugin enabled.
 *
 * Four rules, and the last two are the ones easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - **Enumeration is a pure read.** `enumerate` answers "what can I see from
 *   here" against Claude's own settings and the filesystem, and returns data
 *   with no closures in it. Removal is a separate switch. That split is what
 *   makes the list testable against a fixture directory rather than only by
 *   performing it.
 * - **Machine state starts selected; git-tracked files do not.** The user asked
 *   to uninstall, so making them re-name each piece would turn a cleanup into a
 *   quiz — but a row whose removal edits a file the current checkout *tracks*
 *   would dirty their working tree, which is not a cleanup. Those start off. See
 *   `Item.tracked`. The numbers **toggle**.
 * - **Removal goes through the owner.** A plugin leaves by
 *   `claude plugin uninstall`, never by editing `enabledPlugins` — Claude keeps
 *   bookkeeping beside that key and hand-editing it strands the two apart. A
 *   receipted install leaves by **being reverted**, so what the user had before
 *   comes back; a bare delete would leave them with nothing there at all and no
 *   way to tell what it had been.
 * - **No TTY fails rather than guesses** — but only once there is something to
 *   remove. A run that finds nothing has nothing to ask about, so it says so and
 *   exits 0 whether or not anyone is watching.
 *
 * ## The legacy-receipt reader
 *
 * **This CLI writes no receipts.** It installs plugins by driving Claude's own
 * commands, and Claude keeps its own records — so every receipt in the receipt directory is the record of an
 * install by an *older* version: the copied Claude marketplace payload, and the
 * per-target installs of the render-target era. Those mechanisms are
 * discontinued, and this reader is deliberately kept: without it a machine
 * carrying them is orphaned rather than cleaned, because nothing else on earth
 * knows those paths.
 *
 * **Only Claude Code is supported**, so the retired targets — OpenCode, Cursor,
 * Oh-My-Pi — lost their named entries. A receipt of theirs still on disk is
 * still enumerated and still reverted, under a generic label: the map is a
 * label lookup, not an allowlist, and a machine carrying one is the machine
 * most in need of cleaning.

 * So the entries for the retired targets — `cursor.json`, `ohmypi.json`,

 *
 * `claude.json` is that one: its `command` entries claim the marketplace
