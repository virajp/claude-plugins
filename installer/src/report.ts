 * per plugin installed, or per thing an uninstall removed.
 *
 * The table survived the narrowing, and the reason is the uninstall: it
 * enumerates a variable number of pieces and each one succeeds or fails on its
 * own, which is exactly what a table is for. `TARGET` became `STEP`, since a
 * row no longer names a tool.
