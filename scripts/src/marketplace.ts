/**
 * Generates the marketplace manifests from the plugin manifests.
 *
 * There are **two**, both projections of the same plugin manifests, differing in
 * exactly one field per entry — `source`:
 *
 * - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — **published**. Every `source` is a
 *   `git-subdir` fetch pinned to a per-plugin tag. This is what users read from
 *   `main`.
 * - `.dev-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — **local authoring
 *   only**, never published and **gitignored**. Every `source` is a
 *   repo-relative path into `.dev-marketplace/plugins/`, the staged copies of
 *   the authored tree that `p:plugins:local` writes under `X.Y.Z+N` versions, so
 *   the authoring machine runs the working tree rather than the last release.
 *
 * Both are written and checked together on purpose. A `--dev` flag was the
 * planned shape and is one more thing to forget; a dev manifest that goes stale
 * fails as a plugin quietly serving yesterday's tree, which is the failure this
 * whole file exists to prevent. Only the published one is *committed*, so
 * `--check` treats an absent dev manifest as not applicable and a present-but-
 * stale one as a failure — see `MANIFESTS`.
 *
 * **Both declare the same marketplace `name`.** That is load-bearing rather than
 * sloppy: a plugin's `dependencies` edge names its marketplace by name, so vwf
 * installed from a differently-named dev marketplace would send its `stackgen`
 * edge back to the tagged one and fail on a tag that does not exist yet. The
 * consequence is that a machine registers one or the other, never both.
 *
 * The published manifest lives at the **repo root**, not under `plugins/`: it is
 * what Claude Code reads when the marketplace is added from this repo. It is
 * **committed**, so what users install is inspectable and diffable in review —
 * which is exactly why this needs a `--check` mode. A generated-and-committed
 * file has no other staleness guarantee; `--check` is the successor to the
 * retired `plugins:render-clean`.
 *
 * **The published projection pins a tag; the dev one deliberately does not.** A
 * relative source resolves against the marketplace root, so it serves whatever
 * is *there* rather than a pinned ref. For the published manifest that was the
 * bug — nothing could be held back from users — and the pinned ref is what makes
 * a release an act rather than a merge. For `.dev-marketplace/`, which no user
 * registers, serving whatever is there is the entire point. See `ref()` for the
 * tag grammar and `source()` for the fork.
 *
 * The projection stays a pure function of the plugin manifests: the ref is
 * *derived* from each manifest's `version`, so no git call and no network are
 * needed to generate or to `--check`. That is why `sha` is not emitted, unlike
 * the official marketplace — resolving a tag to a commit is exactly the
 * impurity this avoids. The cost is that a ref can name a tag that does not
 * exist yet, which `plugins.yml` asserts against on the release branch.
 *
 * The projection is one-directional and lossy on purpose. `mcpServers` and
 * `lspServers` live in the plugin manifest and are deliberately NOT copied
 * across: Claude reads them from the installed bundle, and a second copy in the
 * marketplace is a copy that can drift.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/src/marketplace.ts            write both manifests
 *   node scripts/src/marketplace.ts --check    fail if either committed file differs
