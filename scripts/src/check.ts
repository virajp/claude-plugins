/**
 * Static validation of the authored `plugins/` tree.
 *
 * The successor to the renderer's 1000-line checker, and much smaller — not
 * because less is checked, but because a whole half of what it checked stopped
 * existing. There is one tree now, authored in Claude Code's native format, so
 * the per-target passes (no surviving template tags, per-target frontmatter,
 * per-target reference resolution, the coverage report) have nothing to run
 * against, and the neutral-schema assertions they existed to protect —
 * `it.cmd()` targets, `prefixSkillNames` bare-name delegation, cross-plugin
 * skill-name uniqueness, invocation projection — describe mechanisms that are
 * gone. Deleting them was the point of the cutover, not a regression.
 *
 * What survives is what no format and no type can state: cross-file agreement,
 * things that must exist on disk, and the two contracts vwf enforces by
 * *constructing* a skill name — where the failure mode is silence rather than an
 * error, which is what makes a static check the only place they are catchable.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/src/check.ts

 *   permission error, which reads as a pack that never shipped it;
 * - and starts with a **known shebang** — mise executes the file directly, so a
 *   missing or exotic one is an exec-format error at the first `mise run`;
 * - a **hook script** lands executable and shebanged too, on the same reasoning
 *   from the other end: the materializer copies `hooks/*.sh` to
 *   `.claude/hooks/` and wires it into settings.json as a bare path, so the
 *   host execs the file — and a hook fault is the quietest fault there is,
 *   because nothing downstream of it ever reports that it did not run;
 * - the `config/` tier's **root stays allowlisted**, because everything else
 *   belongs under `.config/` and nothing else looks at what a pack puts beside
 *   it — and inside the one forge directory the list admits, a **workflow file
 *   is refused**: a pack states which task CI runs and never writes the
 *   workflow;
 * - a **pre-commit fragment parses** and declares `repos:`, because `/vwf:init`
 *   concatenates the fragments into one pre-commit config and a malformed one
 *   breaks a file no pack owns;
 * - the gate pack's **whole pre-commit config** — which is neither a fragment
 *   nor at the `config/` root, so nothing else here reaches it — parses and
 *   declares `repos:` on the same reasoning, from the base end;
 * - an **editor fragment** parses as JSONC and carries only `settings`,
 *   `nesting` and `extensions`, because init merges the fragments into a file
 *   no pack owns and a key outside the three is dropped without a word.
 *
 * The walk is its own rather than `plugin.files`: most of these paths run
 * through `.config/`, and the reader's glob does not descend into a dot
 * segment, so the whole tier is invisible there.
